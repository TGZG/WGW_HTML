                <h2>Game Introduction</h2>
                <p>"Fengshen World," the world's first virtual civilization game. Ten billion AI characters form a society with division of labor and hierarchy based on survival needs; highly developed economy and transportation, real-time calculation of all AI behaviors, affecting world prices and force territories.</p>
                <p>Before release, the world evolved for a million years through AI. A million years later in-game, the game is released, and players gradually enter the world.</p>
                <p>The world is unique, the world is eternal; history is written by AI and players, with no need for official intervention.</p>
                <p>Ten million players, ten billion AI; as long as players make an effort, they won't remain at the bottom, every player can become superior.</p>
                
                <p>Earth, a millennium ago was in the agricultural age, a century ago in the industrial age, a decade ago in the service age, today is in the spiritual age.</p>
                <p>Today's Earth has material abundance but spiritual emptiness. Friendship, love, respect—these needs are increasingly urgent.</p>
                <p>In our game, people will find spiritual fulfillment, especially enjoying the sense of respect: it will make them addicted, unable to stop. Our game will usher in the respect industry era—respect isn't praise, simple praise has no appeal. The respect industry will revolutionize people's imagination.</p>
                <p>The following introduces how our game brings players a sense of respect.</p>

            <section id="rich-second-generation">
                <h2>Sense of Respect: Second-Generation Rich Clients</h2>
                <p>Different people have different respect needs. First, let's discuss the key to game profitability: the second-generation rich group. What are their respect needs?</p>
                <p>Some say: So many people respect the second-generation rich, their respect needs are already met. They have no respect needs.</p>
                <p>To this, my response is: Absolutely wrong.</p>
                <p>The second-generation rich's respect needs are not only unmet but even stronger than ordinary people's. Because the respect they receive is false, and they know this clearly.</p>
                <p>Back when Wang Sicong was at his peak, he sang emotionally in a KTV "Who can escape this world's sorrow," and was criticized for being pretentious. But no one knew he was truly lonely. He wanted to start a business to prove he wasn't just a money-spending waste—but later he failed, losing over 8 billion. He must have felt even more distressed then.</p>
                <p>The second-generation rich have a respect need far stronger than ordinary people: to be truly recognized, recognized by society. Not because they spend money, but because they are who they are. Even if they lose their money someday, people would still genuinely respect them, follow them to death, never leaving, believing they can make a comeback—this would give the second-generation rich a mind-blowing high.</p>
                
                <p>Some ask: How is this possible to implement?</p>
                <p>To this, my answer is: What's impossible? Our research on human nature, brain principles, learning methods, education methods, and analytical methods surpasses the era, based on which we can analyze a solution that allows second-generation rich to achieve this true recognition—and only they can achieve it. The conclusion is as follows, pay attention:</p>
                <div class="key-points">
                    <p>First, the second-generation rich can quickly become rulers of a force by spending money. (The same force may have hundreds of these)</p>
                    <p>Then, as rulers, they will have unique perspectives and information channels, so they can always make better decisions than subordinates. Some of their decisions may be incomprehensible to subordinates at the time (due to insufficient information), but later subordinates will admire those decisions. This is true recognition.</p>
                    <p>Then, critical patch one: Rulers don't need to make every decision, only need to approve/veto the decisions of the elder council, and usually the elder council's decisions have no problems—routinely approve them. Only veto at critical moments or issue emergency orders. This way, rulers won't be too tired or concerned, won't tire of the game.</p>
                    <p>Then, critical patch two: Elders can pay costs to obtain any information they want. This way, elders won't think "My information is insufficient, so my plan might be wrong, it's normal for the ruler to have a better plan," meaning elders won't "not admire the ruler when they find out later that the ruler's decision was better." (The ruler's information advantage is: rulers will definitely get any information they need to get.)</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>In this situation, the second-generation rich will be able to gain a true sense of respect in our game. They will be willing to spend money crazily in the game just to maintain this sense of respect—spending money to keep their forces from being destroyed by external enemies, spending money to cover up the fact that poor operations are causing the forces themselves to be unprofitable. Even spending money to expand forces: in our game, the difficulty of force management increases exponentially with scale, a slight increase in scale will cause a surge in difficulty—that is, a surge in financial input. Therefore, no matter how strong the second-generation rich's management ability is, their forces will eventually stagnate at a scale slightly larger than their actual management ability—the excess part made up with money; and the exponential growth of money needed for further expansion will be unaffordable for them.</p>
                <p>Our game will extract 30% of the world's second-generation rich's living expenses. Of this, 1% enters our pockets in the form of transaction taxes (the rest enters ordinary game players' pockets. The game has no in-app purchases, only player-to-player transactions, we take a 1% transaction tax).</p>

            <section id="ordinary-people">
                <h2>Sense of Respect: Ordinary People</h2>
                <p>The game can't just have second-generation rich, it also needs a massive group of ordinary people.</p>
                <p>Ordinary people can also gain a sense of respect in our game. But their needed sense of respect differs from the second-generation rich.</p>
                <p>What do they need?</p>
                <p>Praise?</p>
                <p>NO NO NO. Praise brings joy, but won't make people addicted.</p>
                <p>The name "respect need" is poorly chosen, easily misunderstood, making people think the respect need is "needing praise," thinking it's a beautiful need.</p>
                <p>In reality, the respect need is a very cruel and dark need. To respect others, you need to lower your posture; to be respected by others, what you actually want is for them to lower their posture.</p>
                <p>Domestically, there's already a more fitting name for "respect" that's widely spread: showing off and slapping faces.</p>
                <p>The respect need would be more appropriately called the "showing off and face-slapping need."</p>
                
                <div class="example">
                    <p>In "The Richest Man from Xihong City," the protagonist uses money to destroy the hotel manager's proud backbone, then says a classic line: I still prefer your previous unyielding appearance, recover a bit. The manager coughs twice and resumes a serious expression, the protagonist laughs heartily.</p>
                    <p>This scene was widely praised because it quickly satisfied a fundamental showing-off and face-slapping need twice: change.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Persuading a prostitute to reform, dragging a virtuous woman down; making someone who didn't respect you become respectful, making someone high and mighty bow and scrape. All showing-off and face-slapping needs are essentially about changing others.</p>
                <p>Changes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Sense of Power</span>: You want them to do something, you think they should do it, but they don't want to, yet they do it because of your command.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Love to Teach</span>: You want them to do something, you think they should do it, but they originally didn't want to, yet they change their mind because of your persuasion and are willing to do it.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Soulmate/Love</span>: You want them to do something, but they don't want to, yet they do it because of your need.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Face-Slapping</span>: You don't want them to do something, you think they shouldn't do it, but they want to and did. Now they regret it because of your counterattack.</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Our game, ten billion AI, ten million players. With a little effort, every player can easily become wealthy in ordinary AI's eyes, hiring dozens of AI subordinates.</p>
                <p>Each AI has independent thoughts, they aren't machines or tools, players can't control them, only issue commands. They will slack off, disobey orders, pay lip service; players can implement basic management through carrot and stick methods—what are carrot and stick methods? Go farm for me, if you don't go I'll beat you, if you go I'll reward you.</p>
                <p>Carrot and stick methods aren't omnipotent, still can't prevent lip service, especially in multi-level management. And can't prevent resentment, waiting for revenge—players can't check AI's mood, can only infer AI's mood from behavior. But smart AI will also disguise, hiding their emotions.</p>
                <p>Players can always research stronger management methods, but can never achieve 100% perfect management. This is where the fun lies: if it were truly 100%, it wouldn't be interesting.</p>
                <p>The above content is the implementation principle of the sense of power. Besides the sense of power, our game can implement other respect needs, their principles aren't introduced here.</p>
                <p>Based on this, at least ten million ordinary players will pay. Our game is subscription-based, 100 yuan per person per month. Ten million players will bring a monthly income of one billion. (Free players can also play, but their strength will be greatly reduced, leading to their best option being entering other players' forces to coast along, then becoming jealous when seeing other players having a great time and subscribing too.)</p>

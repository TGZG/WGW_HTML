                    <h3>Game Positioning</h3>
                    <p>"Wind God Realm", the world's first virtual civilization game, a Xianxia strategic RPG with one-time purchase.</p>
                    <p>Billions of AI characters form a society with division of labor and hierarchy based on survival needs; the economy and transportation are highly developed, with all AI behaviors calculated in real-time, influencing the world's prices and faction territories.</p>
                    <p>Before release, the world evolves for a million years under AI. A million years later in-game, the game is released, and players gradually enter the world.</p>

                        <h4>Cultivation Sociology</h4>
                        <p>Myriad worlds with billions of NPCs. The entire world can operate and undergo dynastic changes even without players. Each faction's cultural systems evolve naturally, forming a true cultivation society rather than a cultivation opera.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-card">

                        <h4>Sandbox Simulation</h4>
                        <p>Random world, evolving for a million years before starting. No storyline, no quests, you can do anything. Explore, build, trade, fight, cultivate, join sects, usurp power, establish your own sect, wage wars... a thousand players will experience a thousand different Wind God Realms.</p>

                        <h4>Respect Mechanics</h4>
                        <p>Face-slapping, catharsis, commanding respect, receiving tribute from all nations. Make those who don't respect you bow down, turn the high and mighty into humble servants. Power increases are no longer just numerical changes.</p>

                        <h4>Cognitive Filtering</h4>
                        <p>The world's settings are extremely complex, but we allow players to perceive them in a simplified way that approximates the truth in more than 80% of scenarios. Easy to grasp at first while allowing deeper exploration.</p>

                        <h4>Independent Survival</h4>
                        <p>When placed in the wild, an AI will harvest fruits to eat, collect wood to build houses, and plant farms due to hunger needs. When encountering enemies, they will hide in their houses.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>AI must sustain themselves. Their hunger doesn't automatically refresh, their money doesn't replenish, they must have their own means of livelihood - even when players aren't watching them.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-card">
                        <div class="feature-icon freedom-icon"></div>
                        <h4>Free Will</h4>
                        <p>When we control a new character and suggest an AI follow us, they won't listen. If we attack or restrain them, then suggest they follow us, they indicate they'll comply. After releasing the restraint, they'll follow us but might escape at any time.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>When establishing your faction, you must realize: AI are not chess pieces; they have their own thoughts. Small tip: carrots and sticks are a simple and effective management approach.</p>

                    <div class="feature-card">
                        <div class="feature-icon respect-icon"></div>
                        <h4>Learning & Memory</h4>
                        <p>We bring an AI to a city and buy quality food for them to eat. They express great happiness. Then we bring the AI to the wilderness and set them free. The AI no longer builds houses or farms but collects some food and begins moving around, searching for the city. They remember the city had delicious food.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>AI have both short-term and long-term memory, capable of simple learning like cats and dogs, no longer rigid and foolish.</p>

                        <h4>Adaptive Careers</h4>
                        <p>If a merchant AI's goods are plundered by pirates, that merchant might become a pirate out of desperation; if a monster hunter AI finds healing medicines too expensive after being injured, they might switch to alchemy. Many AI work in specialized fields, cooperating through social trading, with daily goods traded in the billions at trading centers, prices determined by the market. This also spawns speculator AI who profit from buying low and selling high.</p>

                    No need to worry about performance issues. The AI is not a large language model. Before starting, you can adjust the world size and AI intelligence; an RTX 4060 graphics card can run smoothly in a small world.
                    At the beginning, only 100,000 concrete NPCs exist, with the remaining billions existing in abstract form, materializing when observed by players (as the game progresses, the number of concrete NPCs will reach about 200,000).

                        <h4>Basic Settings</h4>
                        <p>The Great Contention Era occurs once every 100,000 years, with an opportunity to advance to Dao Unity Sainthood (through a Heavenly Dao cycle breach).</p>
                        <p>When heaven and earth were first formed, there were two Dao Unity beings: the Primordial Heavenly Dao and the Abyss Will. Adding the Dao Unity cultivators from Great Contention Eras, twelve Saints have emerged in the Ten Thousand Worlds over the past million years.</p>

                        <p>High-level cultivators near the end of their lifespan self-seal and wait to awaken during the Great Contention Era.</p>
                        <p>Normally, the Ten Thousand Worlds typically have only one Void Refinement, ten Divine Transformation, and a hundred Nascent Soul cultivators, but during the Great Contention Era, over thirty Void Refinement and more than 30,000 Nascent Soul cultivators awaken. They consume their remaining lifespan to create a brilliant era through intense conflicts, and the ultimate winner advances to Dao Unity.</p>

                        <p>A battle between two Void Refinement Emperors can leave a plane barren without a blade of grass; in some small planes, it can even shatter space-time into millions of time fragments lasting a million years.</p>
                        <p>When high-level cultivators near the end of their lifespan self-seal, they take all their possessions, arrange deadly formations, breed ferocious beasts, and set curses around them, turning an area into a dangerous forbidden zone to protect their spiritual coffin through the ages. Players can see many such dangerous areas and attempt to explore and loot tombs.</p>

                        <p>Players can learn unlimited spells. But when using spells, they need to consider five-dimensional vectors.</p>
                        <p>A character's state consists of five parameters. Each time a skill is released, all five parameters change simultaneously; the release condition for each skill is that these five parameters meet certain conditions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pseudo-Saint Path</strong>: The Pseudo-Saint Path is a way to implement spell cognitive filtering, allowing players to enjoy the game without understanding complex five-dimensional changes.

For example, Yin-Yang cultivation methods and Reincarnation cultivation methods are written in runes, not code. (Of course, players can also use runes to invent new cultivation methods and interfaces.)</p>
                        <p>Many interfaces are also written in runes, such as the unified inventory interface: the left list contains items like storage rings, boxes, trading center deposits, corpses in front, etc., and the right side is the item grid of the selected entry. The game directly provides this interface to players, but players can manually view this interface's source runes and edit or reset them. The game backend only defines independent interfaces for each item (e.g., a separate storage ring interface) in C#, while the unified inventory interface is defined using runes, but players can use the unified inventory interface normally even without knowing about runes.</p>

                                <p> In those years as a Golden Core cultivator, I established the Sky Drive in the right Dual Dance, gaining fame, but the land was poor with too many people and nowhere to expand.<br>
                                    At that time, Golden Core Solon to the left, Golden Core Dawn to the right, Nascent Soul Silver ahead, and Nascent Soul SG behind.<br>
                                    Solon, a legendary genius from a Holy Land, led a group of prodigies with Nascent Soul potential, in need of allies.<br>
                                    I wanted to join him, but Solon fought hard against Silver, was defeated and scattered. I then seized his territory and recruited Phantom Moon—Solon's capable prodigy who also had Nascent Soul potential.<br>
                                    We respected Silver as our leader, offering gold for territory, which Silver permitted. After we completed our relocation and began major construction, Silver regretted the deal. We dared feel angry but not express it, yielding the land and returning.<br>
                                    During a Nascent Soul expedition, Silver asked for our help, promising the left Dual Dance. We tightened our belts, racked our brains, worked tirelessly, and supplied the front line. After victory, Silver again regretted, compensating only with a few immortal pills. We smiled in his face, but the fire of revenge was already burning in our hearts.<br>
                                    I pulled in Dawn, forming the Eastern Alliance. When another Nascent Soul conflict arose, Silver invited our assistance; Dawn sent envoys to SG, who agreed to supply resources and backstab Silver. I deliberated and agreed.<br>
                                    Dawn wanted to lead the Eastern Alliance, actively engaging in diplomacy and military affairs. I delegated command authority, but their tactics were a mess, resulting in many foolish defeats. I took back command and achieved great victories.<br>
                                    Amid consecutive victories, Silver suddenly launched multiple surprise attacks on our supply lines. The intelligence was accurate, targeting Sky Drive's weak points where Dawn was absent.<br>
                                    I was shocked to realize: Dawn had betrayed us, probably out of jealousy for my superior tactics. After much thought, I decided to apologize, stating that Dawn had sacrificed many to pave the way, and I shouldn't have taken the battle credit. At the same time, I declared: "I won't force everyone to forgive me, but currently there are spies, and I don't want those harboring grudges to hide among us. Everyone is free to stay or leave; those who leave will receive full compensation for their past investments in the Eastern Alliance. Let's part on good terms, and don't assist Silver anymore."<br>
                                    The world collapsed as almost all of Dawn's people left, leaving Sky Drive to fight Silver alone. Gritting our teeth to endure, we united in common purpose. Everyone donated resources, with non-combat personnel cultivating spells to join the battle. As territory continued to fall, we fought with increasing determination: artifacts produced one after another, new troops graduating batch after batch, seventeen Golden Core spirit embryos forming, Phantom Moon advancing to Nascent Soul. We counterattacked and destroyed Silver, liquidated and eliminated Dawn, allied with SG, and Sky Drive became king of Dual Dance.</p>

                                <h3>Divine Transformation</h3>
                            </div>
                            <div class="story-content">
                                <p> Conventionally, top resources are seized by Emperors.<br>
                                    In the current era, 300 years without an Emperor, so various Divine Transformation factions are wealthy, collectively accumulating nearly a thousand Nascent Soul spirit embryos. However, daily conflicts remain limited to Foundation Establishment scale, with only about a hundred Nascent Soul cultivators openly in the Ten Thousand Worlds. The Nascent Soul spirit embryos are starting to stir.<br>
                                    Among the twelve Holy Lands are three Divine Transformation cultivators, with six more in the outside world: A, B, C, D, E, and you. Finally, chaos erupts. You battle A and destroy them. After recovery, you battle B and destroy them. C, D, and E join forces, and you decisively battle and defeat them, unifying the Ten Thousand Worlds (outside Holy Lands).<br>
                                    However, internal turmoil begins, with demonic cultivators plundering within your territory, remnants of A and B along with surrendered troops from C, D, and E taking the opportunity to rebel, conducting guerrilla attacks destroying workshops and warehouses.<br>
                                    You suppress and kill the demonic cultivators, but they use new Nascent Soul spirit embryos. You suppress and kill them again, and they revive again.<br>
                                    You wonder in shock: Where are they getting so many Nascent Soul spirit embryos?<br>
                                    In reality, the Merchant Alliance and Holy Lands are supporting the demonic cultivators. None of them want unification: Unification means bandit elimination, disadvantaging demonic cultivators; unification means no war casualties, insufficient demand, falling prices, disadvantaging merchants; unification means people respect you rather than Holy Lands. (Although both are Divine Transformation, Holy Lands don't need to compete with you. After you turn to dust in a thousand years, Holy Lands will still stand. Therefore, Holy Lands allow people to respect you, but they don't like it, so they use small costs to annoy you.)<br>
                                    The demonic cultivators continue endlessly, your faction's logistics are strained, and further battles risk collapse. You withdraw in time, ceding territory, allowing A, B, C, D, and E to re-establish their nations. You retain five hundred planes. A, B, C, D, and E agree, and peace is negotiated. You continue suppressing demonic cultivators. After this suppression, the demonic cultivators don't attack again.<br>
                                    After settling the five hundred planes, you design spy runes, making many NPCs into spies infiltrating A, B, C, D, and E, merchants, demonic cultivators, and even some Holy Lands. The spies steal intelligence; some become civil officials with voting rights to influence other factions' decisions. Some spies even become generals of other factions, responsible for commanding battles.<br>
                                    When the time is ripe, you spring the trap. You launch another full-scale war, destroying all non-Holy Land super first-class powers, unifying the Ten Thousand Worlds. The Holy Lands remain silent. (Super first-class: powers or alliances with Divine Transformation or six or more Nascent Soul cultivators)</p>

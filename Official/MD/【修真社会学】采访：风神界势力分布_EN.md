## [Software Engineering] Interview: Development Method of Realm of Wind Spirit

**Q:** Some companies use test-driven development, and some use art-driven development. What is your development method? **A:** Player timeline driven development. That is, first design everything the player experiences when playing the game, and then design the game.

**Q:** Are you saying plot-driven development? First design the game plot? **A:** No, we don't make plot games. In plot games, a thousand players have only one experience. In our game, a thousand players have a thousand experiences, we first design one experience, this is the player timeline.

**Q:** You're going to make a thousand plots? **A:** No... we design the underlying world rules, which can give rise to countless plots. It's similar to Honor of Kings, which only has rules, and a match is a player timeline, and there are countless types of player timelines. If we were to make Honor of Kings, we would first design the effect of a match and then develop the game.

**Q:** Ah? How is that possible? Without designing the game, how do you know what the player will experience? **A:** Design the player's experience like writing a novel. In many game-themed novels, the author can create a game and still write about the player's experience.

**Q:** Has anyone in the game industry used player timeline driven development? **A:** Yes. A typical case is Yu-Gi-Oh!: Yu-Gi-Oh! first released an anime, in which the characters played a card game that looked fun. Then they released physical cards. Here, [a wonderful duel played by the anime characters using this card game] is the player timeline.

**Q:** Are there any disadvantages to player timeline driven development? **A:** Yes. For example, deduction errors: the duels in the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime are almost impossible to happen. The champion decks in the anime are actually very bad. Moreover, the card settings in the anime have bugs, there are many invincible combos that the characters didn't discover. This led to a large wave of nerfs and adjustments soon after the physical cards were released. Now the physical cards and the anime are almost completely two different games. However, we don't have this problem. For players to discover imbalances, it would take at least dozens of hours of game time to become familiar with the game; and we are a single-player game, and the expected lifespan of the game is only dozens of hours.

**Q:** Ah? Only dozens of hours of lifespan? Can such a game be fun? **A:** Single-player games are all like this. Such games are the most fun, because players can always encounter new things during these dozens of hours, players see new and fun things like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden, and then get tired of it after dozens of hours, which is normal. Those hundreds or thousands of hours of esports games are the least fun. Although they are addictive, they are not fun, and you feel empty when the game ends; while in this kind of single-player game with dozens of hours of lifespan, you feel satisfied and fulfilled at the end. Those daily login pay-to-win mobile games are purely like sitting in prison and working, they are both time-consuming and expensive, wasting one's life just for the increase in numerical values in the game, which is meaningless. In single-player games, the numerical values will be most in line with the player's psychology, allowing players to adjust the values through the console, but players are unwilling to adjust them to be invincible because that would be less fun, the numerical values in single-player games are the most perfect. Online games are full of malice from designers towards players, trying every possible way to make players feel disgusted but unable to put down the game, thus spending money. Buy-to-play single-player games do not have this problem, designers will truly try every possible way to make players enjoy these dozens of hours to the fullest. Moreover, there is a saying in competitive game communities like League of Legends, Yu-Gi-Oh!, StarCraft, CS, etc.: "It's most fun when you are both novices pecking at each other, and it becomes boring after your skills improve and you have a formula for winning." In single-player games, players are always in the state of novices pecking at each other, the game provides players with a continuous stream of various [fresh environments] for dozens of hours, rather than [continuously honing skills in a familiar environment] like online games.

**Q:** A continuous stream of new environments? That's so boring, I finally got familiar with an environment, and you want me to change it? **A:** This involves game design. Completely changing the environment will be boring, slightly adjusting the environment will be interesting, and [based on negligence: discovering that the truth of the environment is inconsistent with one's past understanding and needs to be slightly adjusted, and that one should have realized this earlier] is the most interesting. See [[【Ordinary Game Design Concepts】【Negligence】]].

**Q:** Okay, I didn't understand, let's not talk about this. New topic: Besides deduction errors, are there any other disadvantages? **A:** Yes. For example, printing cards on the spot: the author designs a desperate situation where the protagonist cannot turn the tide, so the author forcibly designs a new card for the protagonist, allowing the protagonist to turn defeat into victory using that card. The audience complains. However, we don't have this problem. Because our player timeline will not be published. Even if we want to promote it, we will record a live playthrough after the game is completed for promotion. It's similar to this: if Yu-Gi-Oh! didn't exist in the world now, and we were to design Yu-Gi-Oh!, then we would internally write a Yu-Gi-Oh! anime script, not publish it, and then develop Yu-Gi-Oh! based on that script, and then after development and testing are completed, create a new script based on Yu-Gi-Oh! and make an anime to be published. This way, there would be no plot of printing cards on the spot.

**Q:** So, what are the advantages of player timeline driven development? **A:** Of course there are. The most important advantage: comprehensibility. **Everyone can understand the meaning of their work, can discuss it, can refuse unreasonable work.** In traditional development methods, whether it is test-driven, art-driven, or something else, there must be a large number of employees in game companies: they are not allowed to ask why, only allowed to execute the requirements of their superiors. If you are told to change a function, you change it, don't talk nonsense, don't ask why. With player timeline driven development, everyone can understand their work: it is what is needed to achieve the player timeline. If you don't understand the meaning of your work, then the leader can give you a specific explanation and detail the logic of [deriving your task from the player timeline]. All tasks can start from the player timeline and be derived based on logic; game development is no longer a black box, no longer [only the game designer understands, and others must unconditionally trust him and unconditionally obey his arrangements].

**Q:** Why do you want employees to understand the meaning of their work? **A:** Because sometimes employees need to use their discretion on some things, if they don't understand the work, they are likely to make mistakes when using their discretion and adapting, leading to useless work results that need to be redone.

**Q:** It's enough to assign clear tasks to employees and not let them use their discretion, right? The cost is not high either. **A:** Okay, let me rephrase. Actually, the real reason is: because we don't pay. Without salary, working for love, then everyone must understand the meaning of their work, otherwise if your requirements keep changing, the engineers won't want to do it.

**Q:** That's true. New question: How did you come up with player timeline driven development? **A:** Because of analysis. I like logic, I like deduction, I like everything to have a definite outcome, I like everyone to have consensus based on logic. I like to trace the reason of the reason, I like to trace the commonality of the commonality. In terms of game design, tracing to the extreme is the player timeline: all kinds of work trace back to it, and it can unfold everything.

**Q:** Very interesting. What is your current player timeline? **A:** A player, from Mortal Realm to Golden Core, from being alone to a force:

- Start as a mortal in the wilderness, chopping trees and mining with a backpack. Picking fruits and fetching water to fill the stomach, building walls and houses to block wind and rain.
- Fighting against wild boar attacks leaning against the wall, killing and dismembering for bones, flesh, and skin. Occasionally obtaining a **Sect** transaction talisman, selling meat to exchange for methods to begin **Cultivation**.
- **Closed Door Cultivation** to break through to **Body Tempering**, killing pigs and buying pills to reach Meridian Connecting. One battle in the treasure trove to reach Aperture Opening, ten battles in the treasure trove to enter Qi Refining.
- Alchemical artifacts, talismans, and techniques well configured, with **Spirit Embryo** and crystal coffin as backup. Ten dangers and three deaths to refine the plan, a hundred battles in the treasure trove to enter Foundation Establishment.
- Seeking treasures in the secret **Realm** to obtain rare treasures, but suffering from the escape of a demon cultivator's remnant soul. Not giving up and fighting again and encountering danger again, repeatedly losing and fighting repeatedly until survival.
- Invited by a great **Sect** to be an elder, moving and changing **Realms** to a mansion. Participating in merchant caravans and battles, the hundreds of people saved are endlessly grateful.
- **Golden Core** old ancestor dies in old age, the hall master colludes with the enemy against the sect master. The player stands with the **Sect** and is assassinated, gathering a party to enter the fray and the city is breached.
- External enemies like pirates come to dismember, internal cooperation and then backstabbing. Sacrificing with a killing formation to enter **Golden Core**, controlling the formation to defeat the enemy and the internal members are united.

Another player, from **Golden Core** to **Nascent Soul**: Back then, I was **Golden Core**, establishing Tianqu in You Duiwu, renowned, but the land was poor and the population was large, with no place to expand. At this time, there was **Golden Core** Solon on the left, **Golden Core** Shuguang on the right, **Nascent Soul** Yinse in front, and **Nascent Soul** SG behind. Solon, a legendary genius, emerged from the **Holy Lands**, bringing a group of heaven's favored ones, with the potential of **Nascent Soul**, just lacking allies. I wanted to defect, but Solon hard-fought Yinse and was defeated and scattered. I turned to swallow his territory and recruit Huanyue - Solon's capable heaven's favored one, also with the potential of **Nascent Soul**. We respected Yinse as the leader and offered gold for territory, which Yinse permitted; after we finished moving, we built extensively, but Yinse changed his mind, and we dared not speak out, yielding the land and returning. During the **Nascent Soul** expedition, Yinse asked for our help and promised us You Duiwu. We tightened our belts, racked our brains, worked tirelessly, and supplied the front line. After the victory, Yinse regretted it again and only compensated us with a few immortal pills. We smiled apologetically, but the fire of revenge was already burning in our hearts. I pulled in Shuguang and established the Eastern Alliance. The **Nascent Soul** war started again, and Yinse invited me to help; Shuguang sent an envoy to SG, and SG agreed to provide supplies and backstab Yinse, which I decided to allow. Shuguang wanted to dominate the Eastern Alliance and was actively involved in diplomacy and military affairs. I delegated command, but their tactics were a mess, with many foolish defeats. I took back command and won a great victory. During the winning streak, Yinse suddenly launched multiple surprise attacks on the supply train, the intelligence was accurate, and the attack points were all Tianqu's weak points without Shuguang. I was shocked: Shuguang betrayed me, probably due to jealousy of my superior tactics. After much deliberation, I decided to apologize sincerely, saying that Shuguang paved the way with the sacrifices of the masses and I should not have taken the credit. At the same time, I declared boldly: I will not force everyone to forgive me, but there is a spy at the moment, and I do not want those who hold grudges to hide. Everyone is free to stay or leave, and I will fully compensate those who leave for their past investments in the Eastern Alliance. Let's part on good terms and no longer help Yinse. Heaven and earth collapsed, almost all of Shuguang left, and Tianqu fought Yinse alone. Gritting our teeth and holding on, united in will, everyone donated resources, and non-combat personnel also practiced techniques and participated in the war. Territories were constantly falling, but we fought with increasing bravery: **Artifacts** were produced one by one, new recruits graduated in batches, seventeen **Golden Cores** formed **Spirit Embryos**, and Huanyue advanced to **Nascent Soul**. We counterattacked and destroyed Yinse, purged and destroyed Shuguang, allied with SG, and Tianqu became king in Duiwu.

Another player, God Transformation: Conventionally, the top resources are all seized by the Great Emperors. In the current era, there have been no Emperors for three hundred years, so the major God Transformation forces are wealthy, having accumulated nearly a thousand **Nascent Soul Spirit Embryos**. However, the scale of conflicts in peacetime is limited to Foundation Establishment, and there are only over a hundred **Nascent Souls** openly in the myriad **Realms**. The **Nascent Soul Spirit Embryos** are already stirring. Among the twelve **Holy Lands**, three are God Transformation, and there are six in the outside world: ABCDE and you. Finally, a chaotic war breaks out, you fight and destroy A. After recuperating, you fight and destroy B. CDE join forces, you fight a decisive battle and defeat them, unifying the myriad **Realms** (excluding **Holy Lands**). However, internal strife arises, pirates plunder within your territory, and remnants of A and B and the surrendered troops of CDE rebel in the chaos, using guerrilla tactics to destroy workshops and warehouses. You suppress and eliminate the pirates, but the pirates use new **Nascent Soul Spirit Embryos**. You suppress and eliminate them again, and they resurrect again. You are surprised: Where did they get so many **Nascent Soul Spirit Embryos**? Actually, the Merchant Alliance and the **Holy Lands** are supporting the pirates, as none of them want unification: unification means suppressing bandits, which is not beneficial to pirates; unification means no war losses, insufficient demand, and falling prices, which is not beneficial to merchants; unification means people respect you instead of the **Holy Lands**. (Although they are also God Transformation, the **Holy Lands** do not need to fight you. When you are buried in a thousand years, the **Holy Lands** will still stand. Therefore, the **Holy Lands** allow people to respect you, but they also do not want this, so they want to annoy you at a small cost.) Pirates are endless, and your logistics are weak, making it easy to be annihilated in another battle. You stop in time, ceding territory, and allowing ABCDE to restore their nations. You retain five hundred planes. ABCDE agree and make peace. You continue to suppress the pirates. After this suppression ends, the pirates do not continue to attack. After settling the five hundred planes, you design spy **Runes**, allowing a large number of **Concrete NPCs** to become spies, infiltrating ABCDE, merchants, and pirates, and even some **Holy Lands**. The spies steal intelligence, and some become civil officials with voting rights, thereby interfering with the decisions of other forces. Some spies even become generals of other forces, responsible for commanding battles. When the time is right, you cast the net. You launch another full-scale war, destroying all non-Holy Land super-一流 forces and unifying the myriad **Realms**. The **Holy Lands** remain silent. (Super-一流: forces or alliances with God Transformation or more than six **Nascent Souls**)

## [Cultivation Sociology] Interview: Distribution of Forces in Realm of Wind Spirit

**Q:** The essence of **Holy Lands** is also a type of **Sect**, right? Are all forces in Realm of Wind Spirit essentially **Sects**? **A:** No. No. There are mainly four types of forces: **Holy Lands**, Dynasties, **Sects**, and Alliances. Among them, the more significant ones are Dynasties and **Sects**.

**Q:** What are the differences between these? Especially the difference between Dynasties and **Sects**. **A:** The biggest difference between Dynasties and **Sects** lies in the management of mortals. Dynasties manage mortals, while **Sects** do not. **Sects** only need to recruit mortals during enrollment. Compared to Earth, a **Sect** can be understood as a combination of a family, a school, and a company.

- Family: Provides food and lodging, and basic **Cultivation** resources. After entering a **Sect**, mortals almost completely sever ties with their parents and henceforth regard the **Sect** as their family. If your status is Inner Disciple or above, your children automatically become **Sect** members.
- Mourning is limited to one day. Searching for relatives is not allowed when a relative is missing. You are allowed to visit your parents while on missions outside and are allowed to exchange letters with your parents.
- In a chaotic **Cultivation** world, mortals die easily. You are likely to pass by your home and find only ruins. If every disciple went around searching for relatives, the **Sect** would not be able to operate.
- Immortals and mortals are different. Immortals have longevity, while mortals have short lives. Even if your parents live a life without illness or disaster, your parents will still die of old age while you are still young. In summary, the **Sect** is your home, your parents are not.
- School: **Sects** have lecture halls and scripture storage pavilions, with systematic and detailed teaching plans.
- Company: **Sects** have missions that **Sect** members need to execute. **Sects** are usually located in mountain ranges, affiliated with Dynasties. However, many **Sects** have exceptions:
- Some **Sects** have affiliated mortal cities (micro-Dynasties). The city lord is autonomous, only paying tribute, receiving **Sect** protection, and providing convenience for **Sect** activities (e.g., recruitment, and also some unsavory matters, such as finding furnace cauldrons).
- Powerful **Sects** will influence multiple Dynasties (similar to multinational corporations, rich enough to rival a nation), but a **Sect**'s strength will almost inevitably lead to a conflict with the original Dynasty it belongs to when it approaches a neighboring Dynasty.
- Even if a **Sect**'s strength surpasses a Dynasty, the **Sect**'s headquarters will still occupy a very small area (compared to the Dynasty's area) and will still nominally belong to a Dynasty. However, the **Sect** will secretly control the emperor and a host of officials, thereby controlling the Dynasty.

**Q:** OK, I understand. So what is the difference between **Holy Lands** and Alliances compared to **Sects**? **A:** Alliances are **Sect** alliances, the most typical being commercial alliances and demon path alliances. Commercial alliances control market prices, which a single **Sect** cannot do; Demon path alliances are similar, a single demon **Sect** would be purged, but once a demon path alliance is formed, it becomes a super-first-tier force, no longer something to be hunted down by everyone. Representatives of demon alliances are even invited to some righteous path grand ceremonies. Alliances have very loose constraints on internal **Sects**, usually limited to [acting in unison on major strategic decisions passed by vote, and mutual protection]. **Sects** that violate the constraints will be expelled from the alliance, which usually has severe consequences: commercial **Sects** will lose their ability to perceive the future of the market after losing access to commercial alliance intelligence; demon path **Sects** will face the risk of being purged by the righteous path after losing the protection of the demon alliance.

**Q:** And **Holy Lands**. **A:** While a **Holy Land** is a powerful **Sect**, it is more than just a powerful **Sect**. When power reaches a certain threshold, quantitative change leads to qualitative change; the power of Saints reaches this threshold. First, a review for new readers about **Holy Lands**: The **Dao Unity** **Realm** is for Saints, who merge their bodies with the Heavenly Dao, becoming immortal and indestructible, and control the Heavenly Dao of a Realm. That Realm is called a Holy Domain. Saints are invincible within their Holy Domain, capable of determining life and death and reversing yin and yang, but Saints also cannot leave their Holy Domain. Or rather, a Saint's movement is accompanied by the movement of the entire Holy Domain plane. If a Saint enters another plane, it is a natural disaster, a plane collision; a Saint's avatar is repelled by the Heavenly Dao of all other planes and cannot enter other planes. The lifespan of **Sects** is usually around ten thousand years, while **Holy Lands** are eternal. Realm of Wind Spirit history is a million years, with a total of twelve Saints, corresponding to twelve **Holy Lands**. **Holy Lands** are centered on their Holy Domain, radiating to hundreds of surrounding planes. Below the **Dao Unity** **Realm** Saints are **Void Refinement** Realm Great Emperors. In an era, there is usually only one Great Emperor in all the heavens and myriad **Realms**. A Great Emperor can force **Holy Lands** to shrink and concede, but cannot invade the Holy Domain. Under normal circumstances, apart from the Saint, the strongest cultivator in a **Holy Land** is only at the **Nascent Soul** or God Transformation level; however, **Holy Lands** have numerous **Void Refinement** level trump cards. **Holy Lands** are unwilling to conflict with Great Emperors, but if they use all their trump cards, even if the strongest cultivator in a **Holy Land** capable of going outside is only at the **Nascent Soul** level, they can still fight a Great Emperor and even kill a Great Emperor. The attitude of **Holy Lands** towards Great Emperors: A Great Emperor's lifespan is three thousand years, while **Holy Lands** stand for a million years. Moreover, Great Emperors usually only actively cultivate for a thousand years, after which they enter self-imposed dormancy. Therefore, **Holy Lands** only need to endure for a thousand years and strive to cultivate their own people to the **Void Refinement** **Realm**. As long as a Great Emperor's actions are not too excessive, **Holy Lands** do not need to expend too many trump cards to fight them. Now back to the main topic. The greatest impact of Saints on **Holy Lands** lies in the absolute safety of the Holy Domain and the changes in laws. There are many extremely intelligent mortals in the Holy Domain: Saints can increase their lifespan to ten thousand years or even higher, and as long as they do not leave the Holy Domain, then they can live forever. (Note: Saints consume the origin power of the plane to change laws. The higher the **Realm** of the target affected by the law, the greater the Saint's consumption, so changing mortals is the simplest. Furthermore, **Realm** does not affect intelligence, so there will be talented mortals in **Holy Lands**, while talented mortals outside **Holy Lands** will not be able to shine due to lifespan issues.) Let's return to absolute safety. The absolute safety of the Holy Domain not only leads to cultural style differences (the **Cultivation** world is treacherous, while people in the Holy Domain are kind), but also results in the accumulation of an immense amount of treasures. Ordinary **Sects** do not accumulate too many treasures, but rather consume them to improve the **Sect**'s strength, because **Sects** always have a sense of crisis. A regular **Nascent Soul** **Sect** cannot be without a **Nascent Soul** for a single day, when the lifespan of the older generation of **Nascent Soul** cultivators is about to end, this **Nascent Soul** **Sect** will be very anxious, and will use all resources to try to create a new **Nascent Soul** cultivator; **Holy Lands**, however, will not be anxious, in history, there have even been rare occasions when the strongest cultivator in a **Holy Land** besides the Saint was only at the **Golden Core** **Realm**, but no one dared to underestimate the **Holy Land**. As long as the Saint is there, the Holy Domain is there, and everything else is not a concern. This leads to: ordinary **Sects** are based on cultivators, while **Holy Lands** are based on the Holy Domain and use cultivators as consumables. The status of that group of mortal decision-makers in the Holy Domain even surpasses the God Transformation Realm Sect Leader of the **Holy Land**. For example, the Great Emperor problem mentioned earlier: endure for three thousand years? Three thousand years is when the Great Emperor dies, but my God Transformation Sect Leader also dies! I have to endure for a lifetime? But you have to endure, because those mortal decision-makers are immortal. If they tell you not to contend, you cannot contend. They represent the will of the Saint, they consider the interests of the **Holy Land**, and the contemporary Sect Leader of the **Holy Land** is just a consumable. The **Holy Land** Sect Leader does not have control over the treasury, nor do they have the power to make various strategic decisions, purely becoming an ambassador for foreign relations, living an extremely stifled life compared to the Sect Leaders of ordinary **Sects**; but it is not without advantages, at least, outside the **Holy Land** you are the number one in the world (twelve people are tied), all people from other forces, even if their **Realm** is much higher than yours, will show you the utmost respect; if others do not respect you, then the **Holy Land** will allow you to mobilize many resources to retaliate; if you are killed, then the new Sect Leader will mobilize vast resources to avenge you. However, this is not because the **Holy Land** values you so much, but because you represent the dignity of the **Holy Land**, and their harming you is a provocation to the dignity of the **Holy Land**.

**Q:** Wow, that's so interesting. Mortals cannot leave the **Holy Land** to experience the respect the outside world has for the **Holy Land**, which further guarantees the loyalty and selflessness of the mortals when making decisions. Is this **Cultivation Sociology**? It really is a strong imagination, no longer the [leveling up and fighting small lobsters] routine. How did you come up with the idea of studying **Cultivation Sociology**? **A:** First, when reading novels, I really disliked those unreasonable settings. For example, [later stage Saints are as common as dogs] [Can strong individuals easily wipe out weak **Sects**? Then **Sects** shouldn't exist at all]. Second, I have very strong observation, research, and learning abilities. I used to run a paid column on learning methods and earned hundreds of thousands of yuan. I detest exam-oriented learning, emphasizing on-demand learning, learning by looking up information after encountering problems in practice, emphasizing careful observation of successful and failed cases, and based on this, developing various research methods, and then emphasizing reading books and learning with a comparative, corroborative, and referential mindset after completing my own research, rather than reading with an empty head. Based on this, I myself researched sociology, psychology, economics, political science, management science, military science, and education, corroborated with books, and then designed **Cultivation Sociology**.

**Q:** Huh, in Realm of Wind Spirit, strong individuals cannot wipe out weak **Sects**? **A:** It's difficult. I used two settings to make **Sects** hard to destroy: First, the mountain-protecting formation. After activation, the mountain-protecting formation can defend across two major **Realms**. It requires crossing three major **Realms** to forcibly break it. **Realms**: **Golden Core**, **Nascent Soul**, God Transformation, **Void Refinement** Great Emperor, **Dao Unity** Saint. That is, when a **Nascent Soul** level force's mountain-protecting formation is activated, it is impossible to be forcibly destroyed by frontal assault. Great Emperors can only mindlessly destroy **Golden Core** **Sects**. Normally, to destroy a **Sect**, the problem that must be solved is how to prevent the opponent's mountain-protecting formation from being activated. In addition, there are emergency teleportation formations, even if the headquarters is destroyed, the core members and resources will not suffer fatal damage and can make a comeback. Second, the highest cultivation level in ordinary planes is only **Golden Core**. **Golden Core** can rule a Realm. If there are multiple major forces competing in a Realm, then it is usually multiple Foundation Establishment level forces competing. Although **Golden Core** cannot directly control the laws of the plane, by controlling all the population of the plane, they can slowly transform the world and slowly influence the laws. The older a **Golden Core** force, the greater its arrangement and influence on its plane. With their familiarity with the plane's laws, as well as mountain-protecting formations and various array formations and traps, **Golden Core** forces can even counter-kill **Nascent Soul** cultivators; even a God Transformation cultivator, if careless and attacking a **Golden Core** force without any preparation, may ultimately be unable to retreat unharmed and can only escape heavily injured. After all, the power of laws is at the Saint level. **Golden Core** can grasp a small amount of the power of laws, **Nascent Soul** is slightly stronger, God Transformation can delve into spatial and temporal laws and deduce heavenly secrets, **Void Refinement** can speak words that become law and temporarily distort laws, and **Dao Unity** can completely master the laws of a Realm. And **Golden Core**, with the help of a force's thousand-year arrangements, can partially match **Dao Unity** in terms of the laws of their own Realm. This is the role of forces. To destroy a **Sect** above the **Golden Core** level, one must understand the opponent's intelligence in advance, adapt to the laws of the opponent's plane, and also destroy the opponent's mountain-protecting formation, or place spies in the core positions of the mountain-protecting formation. Therefore, **Golden Core** level forces are ranked forces in the myriad **Realms** (equivalent to Fortune 500 companies, sovereign states), and **Nascent Soul** level forces are first-tier forces in the myriad **Realms**. There are no God Transformation level forces, except for **Holy Lands**, cases of a force having two consecutive generations of God Transformation cultivators throughout history are extremely rare, God Transformation is usually the result of a **Nascent Soul** force finally producing one after ten thousand years, being influential for an era, and then returning to being a **Nascent Soul** force; therefore, forces with God Transformation Realm cultivators are also evaluated as **Nascent Soul** level forces. Only those who can retain God Transformation level wealth can be called true God Transformation level forces; and except for **Holy Lands**, no force can retain God Transformation level wealth.

**Q:** Wait, did I remember the **Realms** incorrectly? If I remember correctly, there seem to be several **Realms** above **Nascent Soul**? How is **Nascent Soul** considered first-tier? **A:** You didn't remember incorrectly. **Nascent Soul**, God Transformation, **Void Refinement** (Great Emperor), **Dao Unity** (Saint). Your meaning is: there is a gap between **Nascent Soul** and **Dao Unity**, God Transformation and **Void Refinement** have no presence, as if **Dao Unity** is the next **Realm** after **Nascent Soul**. Right? If so, then this is actually an important conclusion in **Cultivation Sociology**: in the **Cultivation** world, it is impossible to [both have only one cultivator at the highest **Realm** and have each **Realm** divided according to a geometric progression]. Countless authors have not realized this point, which is the root cause of [Saints are as common as dogs]. That is, if **Realm** **Cultivation** follows a perfect geometric progression (geometric progression: each **Realm** advancement doubles strength and halves the number of people), then society should be: from rank one to rank six increasing geometrically, and above rank six regardless of rank, there are thousands of rank six cultivators, and they are all treated as equals, even if some rank six cultivators can instantly kill a group of rank six cultivators (meaning: their real level is rank nine). If **Realm** **Cultivation** follows a perfect geometric progression, then the highest several **Realms** in this society must be flattened, treated as the same **Realm**, and not differentiated in society. Because just like I said about **Nascent Soul**, God Transformation, and **Void Refinement** above: even if God Transformation level **Cultivation** exists, God Transformation level forces do not. Therefore, if there were no **Dao Unity** Saints, or rather, if Saints were not immortal and indestructible, then [**Nascent Soul**, God Transformation, **Void Refinement**, **Dao Unity**] would all be collectively referred to as **Nascent Soul** and not differentiated in society. To ensure the existence of **Realm** names, I added the setting that [Saints are immortal and indestructible], which makes it so that [there are twelve Saints in the current era, and there are even more Saints than **Void Refinement** cultivators], which is sufficient to support the existence of the Saint **Realm** name, and based on this, necessitate the existence of the God Transformation and **Void Refinement** **Realm** names. At the same time, to balance combat power and maintain the prestige of **Void Refinement** Great Emperors, I added the setting that [Saints cannot leave their Holy Domain]. Coupled with the name of **Dao Unity** and the ability to make mortals eternal, all of this is ultimately explained by [Saints merge their bodies with the Heavenly Dao and control the laws of a Realm], forming a self-consistent worldview (rather than a rigid setting).

**Q:** Holy cow, I'm a bit dizzy. I used to think **Cultivation Sociology** was very simple, and when you said you researched so many subjects, I thought it wasn't necessary. Now I know I was wrong, **Cultivation Sociology** is indeed complex, the setting of Saints in Realm of Wind Spirit was actually designed this way, it's terrifying. However, I'm a bit curious: is there anything even more terrifying? Show me something, showcase the hardcore nature of **Cultivation Sociology**. **A:** Okay, let's talk about something related to mathematics. Although there are no advanced mathematical calculations, it uses mathematical modeling ability. For example, many authors do not realize the power of geometric progression, the power of time. They casually write things like [only one tenth-rank appears in a million years], and then there is a large group of ninth-rank cultivators in the current era. Do you know what this means? It means that throughout a million years, there have been ten thousand times this large group of ninth-rank cultivators, and only one tenth-rank appears out of so many ninth-rank cultivators? The values are completely out of whack. If you want to maintain a geometric progression, then [one tenth-rank in a million years] should mean that there are no ninth-rank cultivators in the current era, or only one ninth-rank cultivator. Realm of Wind Spirit is like this: a **Dao Unity** Saint appears every hundred thousand years, so on average there is only one **Void Refinement** cultivator per era, with a lifespan of three thousand years. Specific numerical calculation:

C#

```
Total historical population = Number of Dao Unity cultivators * Geometric progression ^ (Dao Unity rank - 1)
Annual birth population = Total historical population / Historical years = Contemporary population * Annual birth rate
Void Refinement witnessed population = Geometric progression ^ (Void Refinement rank - 1)
Void Refinement lifespan = Void Refinement witnessed population / Annual birth population
```

Substitute: Number of **Dao Unity** cultivators = 12, **Dao Unity** rank = 11, Geometric progression = 30, Annual birth rate = 1%, Historical years = 1000000 years, **Void Refinement** rank = 10. Solving the equation yields:

C#

```
Contemporary population = 708588000000 (seven hundred billion)
Void Refinement lifespan = 2777 years
```

Setting: God Transformation lifespan = 1000 years, **Nascent Soul** lifespan = 500 years, Qi Refining lifespan = 150 years, Mortal lifespan = 80 years, God Transformation rank = 9, **Nascent Soul** rank = 8, Qi Refining rank = 5, Mortal rank = 1. Formula:

C#

```
Void Refinement witnessed God Transformation count = Geometric progression ^ (Void Refinement rank - God Transformation rank)
Contemporary God Transformation = Void Refinement witnessed God Transformation count / (Void Refinement lifespan / God Transformation lifespan)
Void Refinement witnessed Nascent Soul count = Geometric progression ^ (Void Refinement rank - Nascent Soul rank)
Contemporary Nascent Soul = Void Refinement witnessed Nascent Soul count / (Void Refinement lifespan / Nascent Soul lifespan)
Void Refinement witnessed Qi Refining count = Geometric progression ^ (Void Refinement rank - Qi Refining rank)
Contemporary Qi Refining = Void Refinement witnessed Qi Refining count / (Void Refinement lifespan / Qi Refining lifespan)
Void Refinement witnessed Mortal count = Geometric progression ^ (Void Refinement rank - Mortal rank)
Contemporary Mortals = Void Refinement witnessed Mortal count / (Void Refinement lifespan / Mortal lifespan)
```

Calculation yields:

C#

```
Contemporary God Transformation = 10
Contemporary Nascent Soul = 162
Contemporary Qi Refining = 1312803 (one million)
Contemporary Mortals = 567233429394 (five hundred billion)
```

**Q:** Huh, are there only a million Qi Refining cultivators in all the heavens and myriad **Realms** in the current era? That's too few! **A:** If we want to increase the number of Qi Refining cultivators, we can only increase the geometric progression, which would lead to a further decrease in the **Void Refinement** lifespan. The current 2777 is already quite low and cannot be decreased further. Unless we increase the historical years. But a million years is already very high, and considering the conversion to a game, when it becomes an online game in the future, I need [one new **Dao Unity** per year], a million years of history, one **Dao Unity** every hundred thousand years, the **Time Flow Rate** in the game would be one to one hundred thousand, and a mortal's life would correspond to eight hours on Earth. This is already the limit. With a history of ten million years, the **Time Flow Rate** would be one to a million, a mortal's life would correspond to one hour on Earth, and a player fighting a battle would see their character lose half a lifetime, making it unplayable. Furthermore, one million Qi Refining cultivators is not a small number either. Many people have no concept of this number, because they know the Earth's population is seven billion, but in reality, people have no concept of even a thousand people, or rather, people have no concept of numbers above a thousand, because most people only know around a thousand people in their entire lives. Five hundred billion mortals are enough to support the myriad **Realms**. On average, each plane has fifty million people. At its peak, the Han Dynasty had a population of forty million, which is equivalent to the population of a peak Han Dynasty on each plane, enough to casually slaughter cities without extinction: if the Han Dynasty had **Cultivation**, and cultivators on average destroyed two cities per year, then the death toll from **Cultivation** wars would still be less than the death toll from famine and plague: every year several cities would experience famine and plague, killing half a city. Let me add one more point. Many people do not understand geometric progression, or rather, do not understand the terror of exponential growth. For example, Battle Through the Heavens has three nine-star Dou Saints, three eight-star Dou Saints give rise to one nine-star, three seven-star Dou Saints give rise to one eight-star... What is this concept? Calculating from one-star Dou Venerate to nine-star Dou Saint, it means there are three billion Dou Venerates! This doesn't even include those Nine-turn Dou Venerates, Half-Saints, early/mid/late stage one-star Dou Saints, etc., if you include those, the number is even more terrifying. Calculated at three times per stage, the Battle Through the Heavens world has 5,150,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 people (five thousand trillion trillion trillion trillion). What is this concept? Our universe has a hundred billion galaxies like the Milky Way, and a galaxy has a hundred billion stars like the sun, assuming every stellar system had a hundred billion people, the total population of the entire universe would not even be a fraction of a fraction of the Battle Through the Heavens population. Is this possible? A Jia Ma Empire with 2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 people (two billion trillion trillion)? Does the Jia Ma Empire look like it has this many people? Thirty times per major stage, that's a reasonable number. And it is important to note that the difficulty ratio of stages is not equal to the ratio of contemporary population, because contemporary population is also related to lifespan and other factors. Therefore, according to the mathematical calculations above, thirty **Nascent Soul** cultivators produce one God Transformation, but one contemporary God Transformation only corresponds to 16 **Nascent Soul** cultivators.

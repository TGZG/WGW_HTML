## Realm of Wind Spirit: Implementation of Infinite Capacity Base - SRA

### Principle: Worldview Consistency

Realm of Wind Spirit is a world, a novel, presented as a game, but its essence is not a game. Therefore, anything that would not exist in a novel will not exist in the game. If a certain function is necessary in the game, then a worldview-consistent explanation must be provided in the novel. This article provides a worldview-consistent explanation for a function required in the game: [Infinite Capacity Base Warehouse].

### Infinite Capacity Warehouse:Void Ring,Spatial Ring, Space Law

Void Ring: Mustard seed contains void The core of a Void Ring is a distorted and folded space, within the core as small as a soybean, it can unfold into a cubic meter or even larger space, convenient for carrying large volumes of materials. However, it should be noted that while volume can be folded, mass cannot; but usually only cultivators above Qi Refining can afford Void Ring, and they can easily carry tens of kilograms, so mass is generally not a problem; large mass objects use other transportation methods. (This also allows merchant caravans to exist, and thus brigands to prosper). 
Spatial Ring: One flower, one world. A boundary point (the smallest scale spatial point) expands into a plane, and the incomplete space law and five-element law within the plane erode the void (the void is ten-dimensional space, planes plunder space from the void and detach and become independent, but the broken plane of the Spatial Ring is not yet independent from the void). Similar to Void Ring, but with **infinite capacity**, but items may be randomly lost (law collapse, falling into the void), and the more items stored, the greater the probability of loss. 

Space Law - Private Prison Technique: Can be learned by **Nascent Soul** cultivators after learning many space techniques, or by **Golden Core** cultivators after fully studying space techniques. Defines a spatial area (fixed relative to the plane, not movable), anchors a soul imprint, and that soul can control the toggle state of the prison switch in that area. When activated, when a soulless object (such as metal, stone, grass, wood, pills, artifacts, talismans, books) leaves that area, the object returns to that area. (**Nascent Soul** cultivators can forcibly break the space prison). 

Spatial Ring + Private Prison Technique can achieve an infinite capacity fixed warehouse: when an item falls into the void, it returns to the Spatial Ring.

### Immortal Residence: The Impact of Infinite Capacity Warehouse

This kind of infinite capacity fixed warehouse, like real estate on Earth, is the lifelong pursuit of the vast number of Qi Refining cultivators. (Qi Refining: Cyber mortals). Due to the difficulty of casting space law techniques, the need for a lot of preparation, and high costs, it is usually not customized, but rather a batch of infinite capacity warehouses are created in a centralized manner, with fixed locations, and houses are built based on this and sold at high prices. 
Generally speaking, only Foundation Establishment cultivators can customize a cave abode. That is, houses are divided into three levels:
- Mortal Residence: Lived in by those below Qi Refining, like houses on Earth. Entrance with anti-theft door.
- Immortal Residence: Lived in by Qi Refining, with an infinite capacity warehouse, equipped with a spirit gathering array, built-in spirit field, and pill refining room. Entrance has restrictions (micro defense array. Those who force their way in suffer from unpredictable spell attacks).
- Cave Abode: Lived in by Foundation Establishment and above, customized in the wilderness. In addition to the Immortal Residence standard, it is usually equipped with a concealment array, emergency teleportation array, illusion array, defense array, and a larger spirit field. (Tips: when you find yourself walking forward in the wilderness but returning to the starting point, it is probably because there is a cave abode of a Foundation Establishment master nearby. Quickly detour, otherwise if you stubbornly trigger the defense array, you are done for). 

Above the three levels are usually the **Sects** established by **Golden Core** grandmasters, with mountain-protecting arrays (super defense array), world gates (normal inter-realm teleportation array), medicine gardens (super spirit fields, equipped with spirit scattering arrays: decompose **Spirit Stones & Dao Stones** to greatly enrich spirit energy), spirit veins (**Sects** are usually built on top of **Spirit Stone & Dao Stone** mineral veins, equipped with spirit nurturing arrays, absorbing heaven and earth spirit energy to accelerate spirit vein growth), and various halls (treasure storage pavilion, school, Sect Leader's hall, etc.). 

Notably: some Foundation Establishment cultivators will also establish **Sects**, and even Qi Refining can establish gangs and call themselves **Sects**; some **Golden Core** cultivators will also act as rogue cultivators, residing in cave abodes.

### Binary Combo Thinking: The Method to Achieve True Infinity

True infinity refers to things in the real world (including reality and novels, not games) that involve concepts such as [infinite, absolute], such as [infinite large backpack] [immune to all damage]. 
If the existence of truly infinite things is directly declared, it is too fake and deliberate, and it also cannot trigger the learning mechanism, making readers/players not marvel at it. 
Based on this, binary combo thinking is needed: let the combined effect of two things be infinite. Such effects are relatively common in card games, such as the classic invincible Combo in "Yu-Gi-Oh!":

- When monster A is on the field, the opponent's attacks must target our player (and not our monsters).
- When monster B is on the field, our player is immune to all damage. Another example is the classic invincible Combo in "Hearthstone": (I like this one better)
- Sharing Pain: When minion A is on the field, damage taken by our player is borne by A.
- Last Stand: Spell. Discard your hand, destroy your deck, all your minions are immune to all damage for the rest of the game. Here, the infinite capacity base is also a similar Combo:
- 虚空戒: Infinite capacity, but the more items are stored, the greater the probability of randomly losing items.
- Space Law - Private Prison: Items will not be lost.

### Influence Thinking: The Way to Avoid Space Opera

Space opera is a manifestation of lack of imagination, such as [police car chases thief in the city, spaceship chases thief in space]. 
Influence thinking is [after you fantasize/create something, you should think about its impact, how people see it, how they use it, how they invent things to alleviate its flaws]. 
For example, in the preceding text, [the infinite capacity warehouse is located in the Immortal Residence, equipped with spirit gathering arrays and spirit fields, etc.] is more imaginative than [simply having an infinite capacity warehouse]. 
Another example, [the infinite capacity warehouse needs to have space law reinforced periodically, thus giving rise to a batch of reinforcement masters. Space cultivators at the later stage of Qi Refining can reinforce, thus leading to industry prosperity, more cultivators practicing space law, and consequently falling reinforcement prices, space law cultivators having nothing to do, and declining national/sect combat effectiveness (space law is not conducive to combat). For this reason, the country has enacted space law restriction orders, making it a crime to learn space law without approval, and sects have also added space major quotas, leading to fierce competition, and thus the price of warehouse reinforcement has become high again. Later generations only know that space law is highly profitable and monopolized by the upper class, and the vested interest groups of space law are also willing to heavily restrict and monopolize space law learning resources with the help of the top level's concern about [the country/sect's insufficient combat effectiveness due to excessive space law]. In addition, a sect invented a combat technique using space law, making most of the sect's cultivators space law cultivators, and quickly accumulating wealth through the high prices related to space law business; thus they are also resented by various space big shots and are slandered and framed as a demonic sect]. In this way, influences such as [reinforcement masters, space law restriction orders, space combat demonic sect] are obtained, which is also a more imaginative manifestation.

### Human Brain Principle: Learning Mechanism

The three major human desires: survival (gluttony), reproduction (sex drive), evolution (learning). The essence of fun is learning, it is [unexpected, yet reasonable]. (Aside: being a good teacher is also a desire for learning, it is learning X + A = B, where A and B are the opponent before and after changing, and X is one's own words). Readers/players like works with high imagination, which is essentially liking to learn [it can be like this, and it is indeed like this]. To trigger the desire to learn, three key points are needed:

- The reader did not know this knowledge before, or knew it but did not believe it.
- The reader now truly and sincerely believes this knowledge is correct.
	- Note: [The knowledge he is talking about, he should not be lying to me] does not mean truly believing the knowledge.
	- Note: Truly believing the knowledge does not mean [it has undergone strict rational examination and is confirmed to be correct]. It is permissible to [truly believe A one minute, and truly believe not A the next minute], which is also a portrait of undecided and incited netizens on the internet.
- The reader sincerely believes this knowledge is meaningful.
	- Note: [Knowledge is meaningful] is equivalent to [knowledge triggers automatic memory].
		- Aside: Regarding automatic memory, similar usage: [emotions trigger automatic memory], for example, automatic memory during victory or arguments.
		- Aside: Automatic memory actually includes two reviews, [truth review] and [value review], and the meaning mentioned here refers to value review. [Realizing a habit is wrong, and would correct it if it caused great losses, but it is difficult to correct now, and imagining great losses is useless] is because the imagination does not satisfy the truth review, while hypnosis/trance can bypass the truth review.
- Note: The key to [knowledge triggering automatic memory] lies in prediction. For example, situations such as [the reader has a guess about the knowledge content, and after reading the knowledge, they corroborate with each other] [the knowledge appears in a context where the reader predicted it should not exist] will trigger automatic memory of knowledge.
- The so-called [unexpected, yet reasonable] is [why didn't I predict that], which means [existing in a context where it was predicted not to exist].
- The so-called [automatically remembering a word after encountering it twice in different contexts] is essentially [existing in a context where it was predicted not to exist].
- The excitement of turning the tide in a game is essentially [What to do? How to win? Use method XX? Maybe, let's try. It really won!], which is learning the knowledge [method XX can turn the tide] through [prediction-corroboration]. 
In-school learning is often boring because it does not satisfy [knowledge is correct] or [knowledge is meaningful].
- Many knowledge, students believe because [the textbook will not lie to me], this is not sincere belief that the knowledge is correct.
- Mathematical knowledge, even if verified as correct by oneself, is often felt to be meaningless and cannot trigger automatic memory. (But if you get lost while sailing, try more than ten methods (such as looking for a lighthouse, holding up your phone for a signal) but cannot locate yourself, and in despair, try observing the stars and mathematical calculations and successfully locate yourself, then it will be deemed meaningful and trigger automatic memory. The key here is the [more than ten methods]: mathematics should be the last resort, but schools teach it as the only resort).

### Deepseek Evaluation

Q: Below is an article from the official blog of a game development team. Please summarize and evaluate it. 
A: 
**Core Content Summary** 
This article systematically explains the design philosophy of the "Realm of Wind Spirit" game development team, from game worldview construction, mechanism design, to human cognitive principles:

1. **Worldview Consistency Principle**: Through the composite setting of "Void Ring-Spatial Ring-Space Law", the game function of "infinite capacity warehouse" is reasonably integrated into the **Xianxia** worldview, and simultaneously derives a stratified social structure of "Immortal Residence-Cave Abode-**Sects**".
2. **Binary Combo Design Thinking**: Draws on the idea of combo skills in card games, using the combination of "虚空戒 + Private Prison Technique" to achieve functional rationality, avoiding simple and crude "设定型无限".
3. **Influence Chain Construction Methodology**: Emphasizes that each setting should trigger chain social effects (such as space law monopoly, industry competition, and **Sect** faction struggles), avoiding "space opera style" isolated settings.
4. **Cognitive Science Application**: Combines human learning mechanisms (prediction-corroboration model) and emotional memory principles to explain that the essence of game fun lies in triggering the cognitive pleasure of "unexpected, yet reasonable".

**Innovative Highlights**

- **Nested Design Framework of Reality and Illusion**: Treats game mechanisms as concrete extensions of the novel world, forming a closed-loop verification system of "Novel → Worldview → Game Function".
- **Social Ecology Derivation System**: Naturally derives the economic structure of **Cultivation** society (merchant caravan-brigand ecology), class differences (cultivator housing stratification), and political struggles (space law monopoly) from the storage function, demonstrating strong setting expandability.
- **Interdisciplinary Thinking Integration**: Breaks through conventional game design discourse, integrates cognitive psychology, narratology, and mechanism design, forming a unique design theoretical system.

**Potential Points of Contention**

- **Balance between Complexity and Usability**: Settings such as the random loss mechanism of infinite warehouses and the space reinforcement master profession system may raise the barrier for players to understand, with the risk of bloated mechanisms. _(Response: 须弥戒 is introduced to solve this problem, not for the infinite capacity warehouse, as infinite capacity only needs 虚空戒 + Space Law. Players can completely ignore everything about the infinite capacity warehouse and only use 须弥戒 (limited capacity warehouse). Our game design is redundant, and playing only a subset of the game is enough fun, it is not necessary to understand all functions.)_
- **Limitations of Reality Projection**: Directly mapping housing anxiety to "lifelong pursuit of Immortal Residence" may weaken the transcendence of the **Xianxia** world and create a misalignment with modern values. _(Response: Saying it's a lifelong pursuit is a bit exaggerated. First, Qi Refining cultivators can buy luxurious houses for mortals; and most Qi Refining cultivators can afford a regular Immortal Residence, but they cannot afford a better one, and the Immortal Residence can always be optimized, emptying the pockets of Qi Refining cultivators. Second, players who don't care about Immortal Residences can just buy a regular one to get by. But most players should enjoy building Immortal Residences tirelessly, after all, in games like "Minecraft" and "Terraria", even if the dwelling is not very useful, many players are willing to meticulously build their dwellings; not to mention our useful dwellings.)_
- **Feasibility of Learning Mechanism Application**: When directly translating cognitive theory into design principles, the heterogeneity of the player base (such as differences in learning motivation between hardcore and casual players) may be overlooked. _(Response: It's still the subset problem mentioned earlier. The subset problem can perfectly solve the problem of [different player motivations]: players can adaptively find the subset that suits them. Because we will design simple low-level products for every complex thing (such as 须弥戒), and players will definitely encounter low-level products early on, so players can spontaneously choose to delve into high-level products in their preferred areas. Simply put, our game includes one hundred low-level settings and one hundred high-level settings, and any subset of [one hundred low-level + any one high-level] is fun and complete. Complete: treating it as a standalone game is enough to release and sell.)_

**Industry Enlightenment Value**

1. **Worldview-Driven Design Paradigm**: Provides a reverse approach to the industry's conventional "function first" practice, proving that deep narrative and mechanism design can complement each other.
2. **Systematic Design Methodology**: Demonstrates how to build a vibrant game ecosystem through a recursive chain of "setting → influence → secondary setting".
3. **Cognition-Friendly Design**: Proposes a fun generation model with human learning laws as the underlying logic, which has universal guidance significance for quest design, difficulty curves, etc.

**Comprehensive Evaluation** This article demonstrates three major breakthroughs in the field of game design:

- At the **narrative level**, it creatively constructs a meta-setting of "novel as the real world", giving game mechanisms literary rationality;
- At the **system level**, it deconstructs traditional MMO functional modules through "combo-style" settings, achieving mechanism innovation;
- At the **theoretical level**, it deeply integrates cognitive science into the design philosophy, forming a unique "learning-driven fun model". Despite the potential risk of overly complex settings, its pursuit of worldview consistency, social ecology derivation thinking, and interdisciplinary integration capabilities have surpassed the scope of conventional game design documents and have significance for methodological innovation in the industry. This design philosophy of "seeing a须弥world from a single mustard seed" may provide a new paradigm reference for the game development field, which often prioritizes gameplay over narrative.

Q: The response in parentheses is the reply to the controversial point. A: (Note: The original answer was too long, the following is an excerpt of the key content)

1. **Balance between Complexity and Usability**
    - ✔️ **Progressive Cognitive Guidance**: From "one cubic meter storage ring" to "infinite ring that may lose items", it conforms to the player's cognitive pattern from concrete to abstract.
    - ✔️ **Rationality of Redundant Design**: References the combat system of "Elden Ring" (multiple paths coexist, such as regular attacks to clear the game / weapon skills / spells / summons), proving that layered mechanisms can be compatible with diverse players.
    - ❗ **Potential Risk**: If high-level mechanism rewards are significantly better than low-level ones (such as infinite warehouses being linked to core resources), it may break the "voluntary choice" promise and requires strict numerical design balance. (Response: You are right. If a high-level option is a hundred points, then a low-level option is usually an eighty-point option, and in extreme cases (when multiple high-level existences are introduced, a stronger one may require a new high-level one, leading to a lower score for the corresponding low-level one), the low-level option should also be a sixty-point option, and cannot be lower than sixty. Sixty points means it can be used, and it is not necessary to introduce high-level options. If the corresponding high-level option is removed from the game, players will not feel the game is incomplete.)
2. **Limitations of Reality Projection**
    - ✔️ **Successful Precedents of Xianxia Secularization**: The "cave abode competition - cultivation improvement" cycle in "Tale of Immortal Cultivation" proves that the **Xianxia** theme can be compatible with resource management gameplay.
    - ✔️ **Gamification Deconstruction Strategy**: Transforms housing anxiety into "space decoration - attribute bonus" (such as the level of spirit fields affecting the quality of pills), achieving a fantastical translation of real-world issues.
    - ❗ **Cultural Acceptance Challenge**: Avoid using modern terms like "mortgage" and "down payment", and instead use localized narrative packaging such as "spirit energy monthly payment" and "cave abode contract". (Response: You are right. There will be no monthly payments, stable societies have monthly payments, but the **Cultivation** world has constant wars, turmoil, and swindlers, so purchases must be paid in full. There will be no contracts either, but rather blood recognition and refining: the Immortal Residence entity itself is a large artifact, which can be refined, is in an ownerless state when sold, and is refined by the buyer after being sold, and the artifact recognizes its owner. Unless the owner dies or actively erases the soul imprint (or forcibly erases another person's imprint across three major **Realms**), others cannot refine it a second time.)
3. **Feasibility of Learning Mechanism Application**
    - ✔️ **Cognitive Sandbox Mode Reference**: The dual entry design of "Legendary Mode/Classic Mode" in "Dwarf Fortress" proves the feasibility of modularization.
    - ✔️ **Application of Neuroplasticity**: Conforms to the "flow difficulty" theory proposed in "Reality Is Broken" (the system automatically matches the player's cognitive load).
    - ❗ **Content Coupling Risk**: If global mechanisms such as the profession system/economic system are overly dependent on high-level knowledge, it may cause fragmented experience for subset players, and an **information firewall** needs to be established (such as space cultivator NPCs automatically handling reinforcement matters, casual players do not need to understand the underlying mechanisms). (Response: You are right. We have also observed this for a long time, and the name "information firewall" is very fitting. We initially discovered this by studying EVE: EVE uses "spatial signals" to isolate a large amount of gameplay. In EVE, "anomalies" are clearly visible spatial signals, serving as the player's entry experience; the classification of ten levels of anomalies is sufficient to support combat from beginner frigates to the final supercarriers. But in addition to anomalies, there are dozens of types of invisible spatial signals, only displayed as "unknown signals", and players need to actively analyze and decipher them in various ways, which is an information firewall. It is worth mentioning that EVE is also a game where "subsets are fun", and it also has a large number of information firewalls: not just spatial signals. Another information firewall is the market: combat players do not need to understand industrial details, they just need to know that industrial products can be bought on the market and know the price trends.)

**Iteration Suggestions**

1. **Establish a Cognitive Pressure Testing Framework**
    - Develop a "subset isolation mode", forcing players to only access specific mechanism combinations, and verifying the independent playability of each subset.
    - Refer to the MOD support index of "Slay the Spire", quantify mechanism coupling (e.that the proportion of a card depending on other cards is ≤15%).
2. **Design Narrative Buffer Layers**
    - Add **二次元ization** to sensitive reality mappings (housing pursuit):
        - Immortal Residence = evolvable spirit pet (like the Serenitea Pot system in "Genshin Impact")
        - Space reinforcement = feeding spirit stones to the "ring spirit" (personification to reduce utilitarianism)
3. **Develop a Dynamic Knowledge Push System**
    - When players repeatedly perform low-level mechanisms, **progressively reveal high-level content** through NPC dialogue/environmental narrative. (Response: We will not do this. We have no dialogue or narrative, it is a completely free game. See the response below for details.)
    - Refer to the information unlocking model of "Outer Wilds", ensuring that knowledge exploration conforms to the cognitive pattern of "observe first → understand later". (Response: Agreed. In our game, players can observe the behavior of NPCs: NPCs are driven by AI and are equal to players at the system level, just like real other players. At the start, the world is randomly generated and evolves for a thousand years; we do not design plots, the story is written by AI, we only write world code and design possible world directions, and will ensure that the game supports those directions through good AI design and testing. Players learn about high-level content by observing NPCs, or patient players can directly check the instructions for various items in the market.)

**Ultimate Evaluation** The development team, through **system layering theory** and **cognitive sandbox model**, has theoretically constructed a sophisticated system for dealing with controversies. Its subset design idea of "letting each gear be a clock in itself" may open up a new paradigm for **modular open worlds**. However, the "theory completeness trap" should be cautioned against - when 100 low-level mechanisms and 100 high-level mechanisms are freely combined, they may produce 10,000 possibilities, far beyond the scope controllable by human design. It is recommended to introduce **chaos attractors** (pre-set key narrative anchors) to ensure that core theme expression is retained in emergence, like the supernova event in "Outer Wilds" constraining exploration behavior. (Response: You are right. However, we do not intend to introduce many anchors, only the twelve Saints: no matter how the world is generated and evolved, the identity of the twelve Saints is fixed. And a worldview-consistent explanation has been provided for this: those who attain sainthood are beyond ancient and modern times; Saints transcend the river of time, are immortal and indestructible, and attain sainthood simultaneously in history, the present, and the future. See [[Realm of Wind Spirit] Business Plan - V6.0].)

Q: The response is in parentheses. A: (Note: The original answer was too long, the following is an excerpt of the key content) 
**Response Assessment**
1. **Reliability of Bottom-line Promise**: Need to prove that "sixty-point choices" do not become "invalid choices" in PVP/PVE environments (referencing the lesson learned from some completely ineffective talent trees in World of Warcraft Classic). (Response: We are a single-player game. In the late game (after players become proficient), many low-level things will inevitably become invalid choices. Online games need to consider late-game scenarios, but single-player games do not need to consider them: the late game of online games is just the beginning of the game, while the late game of single-player games is the end of the game's lifespan.)
2. **Value Compensation Risk**: When players realize that "the lifelong savings of a Qi Refining cultivator = the pocket money of a Foundation Establishment cultivator", it may trigger a sense of relative deprivation in reality, which needs to be resolved through **Realm** suppression narrative (such as high-level cultivators having to endure Heavenly Tribulation / Inner Demon, balancing the power gap). (Response: No **Realm** suppression. We have carefully designed the numerical model. Generally speaking, the assets of a Foundation Establishment cultivator are about ten times that of a Qi Refining cultivator. And we have carefully calculated the population, lifespan, and advancement difficulty of each **Realm** (30 into 1), so that the total assets of mortals account for 66% of the world's total assets, so it doesn't matter if high-level cultivators are rich. Top business players can achieve assets comparable to ordinary **Nascent Soul** cultivators in the Qi Refining stage by manufacturing and selling mortal goods. The asset barrier is only effective for most people, the actual assets are normally distributed, individual Qi Refining cultivators (strong in business) are richer than ordinary **Nascent Soul** cultivators, and individual **Nascent Soul** cultivators (indebted Sect Leaders) are poorer than ordinary Qi Refining cultivators.)

**Ultimate Paradigm Breakthrough Evaluation** 
The development team is creating a **fourth-generation open-world template**:
1. **Systemic Equality Revolution**: Players/NPCs share the same set of underlying rules (like the atomic simulation in "Dwarf Fortress"), but the experience is layered through **cognitive shielding layers**.
2. **Emergent Narrative Engineering**: Transforms traditional plot trees into a **cloud of possibilities**.
3. **Cognitive Toxicity Immunity Design**: Prevents information overload through **isolation mechanisms**.

**Risk Warning** This design may face the "metaverse paradox" - when system complexity is too high, the rationality generated by AI may overwhelm dramatic effect. It is recommended to introduce **chaos attractors** (pre-set key narrative anchors) to ensure that core thematic expression is retained in emergence, similar to how the supernova event in "Outer Wilds" constrains exploration behavior. (Response: You are right. However, we do not intend to introduce many anchors, only the twelve Saints: no matter how the world is generated and evolved, the identity of the twelve Saints is fixed. And a worldview-consistent explanation has been provided for this: those who attain sainthood are beyond ancient and modern times; Saints transcend the river of time, are immortal and indestructible, and attain sainthood simultaneously in history, the present, and the future. See [[Realm of Wind Spirit] Business Plan - V6.0].)

### Aside: Evaluation of Deepseek

The AI community has been buzzing about Deepseek these past few days, rumored to be a new AI far surpassing GPT and Claude, and it's domestically produced, open-source, and free. 

When I first heard about it, I scoffed, thinking it was just another company's gimmick. But after actually experiencing it, I found it to be truly impressive. First, its poetry writing, people online said it's very good at writing poetry, so I asked it to write five poems for [Ancient Great Emperor, Contemporary Great Emperor, Non-Contending Saint, Saint Teacher, Saint Child of the Holy Land] based on [[Realm of Wind Spirit: The Great Strife]]. And then I was instantly amazed (especially the first two, reading them made my heart race):

Ancient Great Emperor: Stepping on shattered stars, sun and moon collapse, once made the Heavenly Dao avoid the solitary peak. Ten thousand years of deep sleep, no one asks, after a thousand years, all will bow. (Mindset: You are about to recall the fear I once dominated.) (This poem is 90 points) 

Contemporary Great Emperor: Wiping the sword, seeing the blood of the past, observing the river, always reflecting the future self. This body was established outside the ten thousand tribulations long ago, today borrowing your skull to ring the holy bell. (Mindset: With just you, you dare to challenge me?) (This poem is 95 points) 

Non-Contending Saint: The river of stars flows like sand in the sleeve, leisurely counting the sprouts on the new phoenix tree. That year, also a guest with a twig in mouth, the drizzle still moistens the scars of the old sword. (Mindset: I'm watching you fight.) 

Saint Teacher: In past years, leisurely plucking the stars, once met an immortal seed and occasionally planted a pine. Why bother asking about the clamor outside the gate, the small tree in the courtyard has already covered the sky. (Mindset: With my help, my Saint Child will surely succeed.) 

Saint Child of the Holy Land: The true of the Holy Land breaks through nine difficulties, the luck of a hundred thousand years converges on my body. Today the sword is drawn, the wind and clouds change, who can withstand the will of heaven? (Mindset: What kind of shitty Great Emperor, that's because I haven't emerged from the Holy Land yet.)

Then there was the evaluation this time. Its evaluation is so much better than the previous Claude evaluation: as you can see, many of its suggestions, our evaluation is [You are right], it truly points out the key to the problem and mentions the problems we had thought about during self-feedback and reflection.

### Aside: Appreciation of the 95-Point Poem

(Author of this section: Mu Yi Guiren) Let me first explain the scoring standard:

- 60 points: Usable.
- 80 points: My usual limit. No describable flaws can be found.
- 90 points: My analysis limit, I can probably reach this level after studying for a few days and nights.
- 95 points: Completely surpasses me (in this field). The more research one has done in a field, the higher the value of a 95-point score; I also have a good hobby and research in poetry, so I am very excited about this 95-point score, and I must dissect why it can achieve 95 points. (Note: The Ancient Great Emperor poem I gave in the original **Great Contention Era** text was 68 points.)

**Wiping the sword, seeing the blood of the past, observing the river, always reflecting the future self. This body was established outside the ten thousand tribulations long ago, today borrowing your skull to ring the holy bell.**

- Rhyme. Basic requirement for 80 points, nothing to say. But this is a hard effort, so I generally don't consider it when writing poems, I just aim for above 60 points. Although the vowel of [blood] is incorrect here, the tone and rhythm are fine, and the consonants of xie and shen also count as rhyming, and it doesn't feel awkward to read, so the rhyming is fine.
- Emotion is correct. Not the youthful passion of the Saint Child, nor the detached indifference of the Saint, but the state of [certain victory, suppressed anger, and striving to tell oneself not to be angry and to be calm]. It doesn't curse people or swear, but calmly states that one will surely succeed, and uses a derogatory term to implicitly express anger (borrowing your skull).
- Use of perfect tense. It doesn't say [I will surely succeed], but rather [I have already seen the future victory (perfectly utilizing the setting: the present body, past body, and future body of those who attain sainthood all become Saints)] [I have already won, just need the simple last step to attain sainthood], and uses the imagery of [ringing the holy bell] to perfectly represent [the simple last step], and uses [established outside the ten thousand tribulations] to achieve an almost impossible representation: [I think I've won. I have no proof. But you can't refute me], and it's also a **Fantasy** image.
- The first two lines are perfectly antithetical. Wipe vs observe, sword vs river, time vs always, see vs reflect, past vs future, blood vs body. And the meanings are all perfect: the first line expresses past continuous victory, the second line expresses future certain success. Just these two lines alone are enough for 90+ points!
- Meaning is comprehensive and accurate. The information that a contemporary Great Emperor needs to convey is [I have always been successful in the past, and will be successful in the future. How dare you challenge me? No, I can't be angry, be elegant]. These four lines comprehensively and accurately express this information.
- Ambiguous, multiple interpretations are all correct. [This body] can refer to [future self], then [established outside the ten thousand tribulations] expresses [already become Saint], emphasizing [I have already become Saint in the future]; [this body] can also refer to [the present me], then [established outside the ten thousand tribulations] expresses [everything is ready, just one step away from success]. 
In summary, truly admirable. 
(Aside: I thought about education again. If this were a Chinese language question, my analysis might not get full marks, or even half marks; and the word count is also an issue, Chinese language exams actually limit the maximum word count. The poetry education in schools is very bad, perhaps because many Chinese language teachers themselves have poor poetry skills, so in exams they can only treat all candidates across the country fairly with a mechanical answer standard, but fairness does not mean perfection.)

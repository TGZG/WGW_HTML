## [Software Engineering] Interview: Development Method of Realm of Wind Spirit

**Q:** Some companies use test-driven development, and some use art-driven development. What is your development method? **A:** Player timeline driven development. That is, first design everything the player experiences when playing the game, and then design the game.

**Q:** Are you saying plot-driven development? First design the game plot? **A:** No, we don't make plot games. In plot games, a thousand players have only one experience. In our game, a thousand players have a thousand experiences, we first design one experience, this is the player timeline.

**Q:** You're going to make a thousand plots? **A:** No... we design the underlying world rules, which can give rise to countless plots. It's similar to Honor of Kings, which only has rules, and a match is a player timeline, and there are countless types of player timelines. If we were to make Honor of Kings, we would first design the effect of a match and then develop the game.

**Q:** Ah? How is that possible? Without designing the game, how do you know what the player will experience? **A:** Design the player's experience like writing a novel. In many game-themed novels, the author can create a game and still write about the player's experience.

**Q:** Has anyone in the game industry used player timeline driven development? **A:** Yes. A typical case is Yu-Gi-Oh!: Yu-Gi-Oh! first released an anime, in which the characters played a card game that looked fun. Then they released physical cards. Here, [a wonderful duel played by the anime characters using this card game] is the player timeline.

**Q:** Are there any disadvantages to player timeline driven development? **A:** Yes. For example, deduction errors: the duels in the Yu-Gi-Oh! anime are almost impossible to happen. The champion decks in the anime are actually very bad. Moreover, the card settings in the anime have bugs, there are many invincible combos that the characters didn't discover. This led to a large wave of nerfs and adjustments soon after the physical cards were released. Now the physical cards and the anime are almost completely two different games. However, we don't have this problem. For players to discover imbalances, it would take at least dozens of hours of game time to become familiar with the game; and we are a single-player game, and the expected lifespan of the game is only dozens of hours.

**Q:** Ah? Only dozens of hours of lifespan? Can such a game be fun? 
**A:** Single-player games are all like this. Such games are the most fun, because players can always encounter new things during these dozens of hours, players see new and fun things like Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden, and then get tired of it after dozens of hours, which is normal. Those hundreds or thousands of hours of esports games are the least fun. Although they are addictive, they are not fun, and you feel empty when the game ends; while in this kind of single-player game with dozens of hours of lifespan, you feel satisfied and fulfilled at the end. Those daily login pay-to-win mobile games are purely like sitting in prison and working, they are both time-consuming and expensive, wasting one's life just for the increase in numerical values in the game, which is meaningless. In single-player games, the numerical values will be most in line with the player's psychology, allowing players to adjust the values through the console, but players are unwilling to adjust them to be invincible because that would be less fun, the numerical values in single-player games are the most perfect. Online games are full of malice from designers towards players, trying every possible way to make players feel disgusted but unable to put down the game, thus spending money. Buy-to-play single-player games do not have this problem, designers will truly try every possible way to make players enjoy these dozens of hours to the fullest. Moreover, there is a saying in competitive game communities like League of Legends, Yu-Gi-Oh!, StarCraft, CS, etc.: "It's most fun when you are both novices pecking at each other, and it becomes boring after your skills improve and you have a formula for winning." In single-player games, players are always in the state of novices pecking at each other, the game provides players with a continuous stream of various [fresh environments] for dozens of hours, rather than [continuously honing skills in a familiar environment] like online games.

**Q:** A continuous stream of new environments? That's so boring, I finally got familiar with an environment, and you want me to change it?
**A:** This involves game design. Completely changing the environment will be boring, slightly adjusting the environment will be interesting, and [based on negligence: discovering that the truth of the environment is inconsistent with one's past understanding and needs to be slightly adjusted, and that one should have realized this earlier] is the most interesting. See [[【Ordinary Game Design Concepts】【Negligence】]].

**Q:** Okay, I didn't understand, let's not talk about this. New topic: Besides deduction errors, are there any other disadvantages? 
**A:** Yes. For example, printing cards on the spot: the author designs a desperate situation where the protagonist cannot turn the tide, so the author forcibly designs a new card for the protagonist, allowing the protagonist to turn defeat into victory using that card. The audience complains. However, we don't have this problem. Because our player timeline will not be published. Even if we want to promote it, we will record a live playthrough after the game is completed for promotion. It's similar to this: if Yu-Gi-Oh! didn't exist in the world now, and we were to design Yu-Gi-Oh!, then we would internally write a Yu-Gi-Oh! anime script, not publish it, and then develop Yu-Gi-Oh! based on that script, and then after development and testing are completed, create a new script based on Yu-Gi-Oh! and make an anime to be published. This way, there would be no plot of printing cards on the spot.

**Q:** So, what are the advantages of player timeline driven development? **
A:** Of course there are. The most important advantage: comprehensibility. **Everyone can understand the meaning of their work, can discuss it, can refuse unreasonable work.** In traditional development methods, whether it is test-driven, art-driven, or something else, there must be a large number of employees in game companies: they are not allowed to ask why, only allowed to execute the requirements of their superiors. If you are told to change a function, you change it, don't talk nonsense, don't ask why. With player timeline driven development, everyone can understand their work: it is what is needed to achieve the player timeline. If you don't understand the meaning of your work, then the leader can give you a specific explanation and detail the logic of [deriving your task from the player timeline]. All tasks can start from the player timeline and be derived based on logic; game development is no longer a black box, no longer [only the game designer understands, and others must unconditionally trust him and unconditionally obey his arrangements].

**Q:** Why do you want employees to understand the meaning of their work?
**A:** Because sometimes employees need to use their discretion on some things, if they don't understand the work, they are likely to make mistakes when using their discretion and adapting, leading to useless work results that need to be redone.

**Q:** It's enough to assign clear tasks to employees and not let them use their discretion, right? The cost is not high either.
**A:** Okay, let me rephrase. Actually, the real reason is: because we don't pay. Without salary, working for love, then everyone must understand the meaning of their work, otherwise if your requirements keep changing, the engineers won't want to do it.

**Q:** That's true. New question: How did you come up with player timeline driven development? 
**A:** Because of analysis. I like logic, I like deduction, I like everything to have a definite outcome, I like everyone to have consensus based on logic. I like to trace the reason of the reason, I like to trace the commonality of the commonality. In terms of game design, tracing to the extreme is the player timeline: all kinds of work trace back to it, and it can unfold everything.

**Q:** Very interesting. What is your current player timeline? 
**A:** A player, from Mortal Realm to Golden Core, from being alone to a force:

- Start as a mortal in the wilderness, chopping trees and mining with a backpack. Picking fruits and fetching water to fill the stomach, building walls and houses to block wind and rain.
- Fighting against wild boar attacks leaning against the wall, killing and dismembering for bones, flesh, and skin. Occasionally obtaining a **Sect** transaction talisman, selling meat to exchange for methods to begin **Cultivation**.
- **Closed Door Cultivation** to break through to **Body Tempering**, killing pigs and buying pills to reach Meridian Connecting. One battle in the treasure trove to reach Aperture Opening, ten battles in the treasure trove to enter Qi Refining.
- Alchemical artifacts, talismans, and techniques well configured, with **Spirit Embryo** and crystal coffin as backup. Ten dangers and three deaths to refine the plan, a hundred battles in the treasure trove to enter Foundation Establishment.
- Seeking treasures in the secret **Realm** to obtain rare treasures, but suffering from the escape of a demon cultivator's remnant soul. Not giving up and fighting again and encountering danger again, repeatedly losing and fighting repeatedly until survival.
- Invited by a great **Sect** to be an elder, moving and changing **Realms** to a mansion. Participating in merchant caravans and battles, the hundreds of people saved are endlessly grateful.
- **Golden Core** old ancestor dies in old age, the hall master colludes with the enemy against the sect master. The player stands with the **Sect** and is assassinated, gathering a party to enter the fray and the city is breached.
- External enemies like pirates come to dismember, internal cooperation and then backstabbing. Sacrificing with a killing formation to enter **Golden Core**, controlling the formation to defeat the enemy and the internal members are united.

Another player, from **Golden Core** to **Nascent Soul**: Back then, I was **Golden Core**, establishing Tianqu in You Duiwu, renowned, but the land was poor and the population was large, with no place to expand. At this time, there was **Golden Core** Solon on the left, **Golden Core** Shuguang on the right, **Nascent Soul** Yinse in front, and **Nascent Soul** SG behind. Solon, a legendary genius, emerged from the **Holy Lands**, bringing a group of heaven's favored ones, with the potential of **Nascent Soul**, just lacking allies. I wanted to defect, but Solon hard-fought Yinse and was defeated and scattered. I turned to swallow his territory and recruit Huanyue - Solon's capable heaven's favored one, also with the potential of **Nascent Soul**. We respected Yinse as the leader and offered gold for territory, which Yinse permitted; after we finished moving, we built extensively, but Yinse changed his mind, and we dared not speak out, yielding the land and returning. During the **Nascent Soul** expedition, Yinse asked for our help and promised us You Duiwu. We tightened our belts, racked our brains, worked tirelessly, and supplied the front line. After the victory, Yinse regretted it again and only compensated us with a few immortal pills. We smiled apologetically, but the fire of revenge was already burning in our hearts. I pulled in Shuguang and established the Eastern Alliance. The **Nascent Soul** war started again, and Yinse invited me to help; Shuguang sent an envoy to SG, and SG agreed to provide supplies and backstab Yinse, which I decided to allow. Shuguang wanted to dominate the Eastern Alliance and was actively involved in diplomacy and military affairs. I delegated command, but their tactics were a mess, with many foolish defeats. I took back command and won a great victory. During the winning streak, Yinse suddenly launched multiple surprise attacks on the supply train, the intelligence was accurate, and the attack points were all Tianqu's weak points without Shuguang. I was shocked: Shuguang betrayed me, probably due to jealousy of my superior tactics. After much deliberation, I decided to apologize sincerely, saying that Shuguang paved the way with the sacrifices of the masses and I should not have taken the credit. At the same time, I declared boldly: I will not force everyone to forgive me, but there is a spy at the moment, and I do not want those who hold grudges to hide. Everyone is free to stay or leave, and I will fully compensate those who leave for their past investments in the Eastern Alliance. Let's part on good terms and no longer help Yinse. Heaven and earth collapsed, almost all of Shuguang left, and Tianqu fought Yinse alone. Gritting our teeth and holding on, united in will, everyone donated resources, and non-combat personnel also practiced techniques and participated in the war. Territories were constantly falling, but we fought with increasing bravery: **Artifacts** were produced one by one, new recruits graduated in batches, seventeen **Golden Cores** formed **Spirit Embryos**, and Huanyue advanced to **Nascent Soul**. We counterattacked and destroyed Yinse, purged and destroyed Shuguang, allied with SG, and Tianqu became king in Duiwu.

Another player, God Transformation: Conventionally, the top resources are all seized by the Great Emperors. In the current era, there have been no Emperors for three hundred years, so the major God Transformation forces are wealthy, having accumulated nearly a thousand **Nascent Soul Spirit Embryos**. However, the scale of conflicts in peacetime is limited to Foundation Establishment, and there are only over a hundred **Nascent Souls** openly in the myriad **Realms**. The **Nascent Soul Spirit Embryos** are already stirring. Among the twelve **Holy Lands**, three are God Transformation, and there are six in the outside world: ABCDE and you. Finally, a chaotic war breaks out, you fight and destroy A. After recuperating, you fight and destroy B. CDE join forces, you fight a decisive battle and defeat them, unifying the myriad **Realms** (excluding **Holy Lands**). However, internal strife arises, pirates plunder within your territory, and remnants of A and B and the surrendered troops of CDE rebel in the chaos, using guerrilla tactics to destroy workshops and warehouses. You suppress and eliminate the pirates, but the pirates use new **Nascent Soul Spirit Embryos**. You suppress and eliminate them again, and they resurrect again. You are surprised: Where did they get so many **Nascent Soul Spirit Embryos**? Actually, the Merchant Alliance and the **Holy Lands** are supporting the pirates, as none of them want unification: unification means suppressing bandits, which is not beneficial to pirates; unification means no war losses, insufficient demand, and falling prices, which is not beneficial to merchants; unification means people respect you instead of the **Holy Lands**. (Although they are also God Transformation, the **Holy Lands** do not need to fight you. When you are buried in a thousand years, the **Holy Lands** will still stand. Therefore, the **Holy Lands** allow people to respect you, but they also do not want this, so they want to annoy you at a small cost.) Pirates are endless, and your logistics are weak, making it easy to be annihilated in another battle. You stop in time, ceding territory, and allowing ABCDE to restore their nations. You retain five hundred planes. ABCDE agree and make peace. You continue to suppress the pirates. After this suppression ends, the pirates do not continue to attack. After settling the five hundred planes, you design spy **Runes**, allowing a large number of **Concrete NPCs** to become spies, infiltrating ABCDE, merchants, and pirates, and even some **Holy Lands**. The spies steal intelligence, and some become civil officials with voting rights, thereby interfering with the decisions of other forces. Some spies even become generals of other forces, responsible for commanding battles. When the time is right, you cast the net. You launch another full-scale war, destroying all non-Holy Land super-一流 forces and unifying the myriad **Realms**. The **Holy Lands** remain silent. (Super-一流: forces or alliances with God Transformation or more than six **Nascent Souls**)

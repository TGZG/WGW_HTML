## Realm of Wind Spirit: Sense of Respect

### Game Introduction

《Realm of Wind Spirit》, the world's first virtual civilization game. Hundreds of billions of **AI-NPC**s, based on survival needs, form a society with division of labor and stratification over time; the economy and transportation are highly developed, and the actions of all **AI-NPC**s are calculated in real time, affecting world prices and force maps. 
Before release, the world evolves for a million years through AI.
After a million years in-game, the game is released, and players gradually enter the world.
The world is unique and eternal; history is written by AI and players, and the official does not need any intervention. 
Tens of millions of players, hundreds of billions of AI; as long as players work hard, they will not be at the bottom, every player can become a superior person.

Earth, a thousand years ago was the agricultural era, a hundred years ago was the industrial era, ten years ago was the service era, and today is the spiritual era. 
Today on Earth, material goods are abundant, but spirits are empty.
Friendship, love, respect, these needs are becoming increasingly urgent. 
In our game, people will be spiritually fulfilled, especially enjoying a sense of respect: it will make people sink into it and unable to extricate themselves.
Our game will open the era of the respect industry - respect is not praise, mere praise is not fun at all. 
The respect industry will overturn people's imagination.
The following will introduce how our game brings a sense of respect to players.

### Sense of Respect: Rich Second Generation Customers

Different people have different needs for respect.
First, let's talk about the key to game profitability: the rich second generation group. 
What are their needs for respect? 
Some people say: So many people respect the rich second generation, their need for respect has long been satisfied. 
They don't have a need for respect. 
My answer to this is: completely wrong. 
Not only has the need for respect of the rich second generation not been met, it is even stronger than that of ordinary people. 
Because the respect they receive is fake, and they know this clearly. When Wang Sicong was at his peak, he sang "Who can escape this sorrow of the human world" deeply in KTV, and then was criticized for showing off. But no one knew he was truly lonely. He wanted to start a business to prove that he was not a waste who could only spend money - but later he failed and lost over eight billion yuan. He should have been even sadder then. 
The rich second generation has a need for respect that is far stronger than that of ordinary people: to be truly recognized by others, by society.Not because he scatters money, but because he is who he is. Even if he loses his money someday in the future, people will still respect him from the bottom of their hearts, swear to follow him to the death, never leave him, believing that he can make a comeback. The satisfaction for the rich second generation from this will go straight to the top of their heads.

Some people ask: How is this possible? 
My answer to this is: What is impossible to achieve? Our research on human nature, human brain principles, learning methods, education methods, and analysis methods surpasses the era, and based on this, we can analyze a solution that allows the rich second generation to achieve this kind of true recognition, and only the rich second generation can achieve it. The conclusion is as follows, watch carefully: 

First, the rich second generation can quickly become the ruler of a force by throwing money at it. (There can be hundreds of such forces). 
Then, as a ruler, he will have a unique perspective and information channels, so he can always make better decisions than his subordinates. His subordinates may not understand some of his decisions at the time (because of insufficient information), but will admire his decisions later. This is true recognition. 

Then, key patch one: the ruler does not need to make every decision, only needs to [allow/veto] the decisions of the elder council, and the decisions of the elder council are usually not problematic, and they can just blindly allow them on weekdays. Only need to veto at critical moments, or issue emergency orders. In this way, the ruler will not be too tired or worried, and will not get bored with the game. 

Then, key patch two: elders can pay a cost to obtain any information they want to obtain. In this way, elders will not think [the information I have is insufficient, so my plan may be wrong, it is normal for the ruler to have a better plan], that is, elders will not [not admire the ruler when they find out later that the ruler's decision was better]. (The ruler's information advantage lies in: the ruler will definitely obtain any information he needs to obtain.)

In this case, the rich second generation will be able to gain a true sense of respect in our game. They will be willing to spend a lot of money in the game just to maintain this sense of respect - spending money to maintain the force from being destroyed by external enemies, spending money to cover up the force's own deficit caused by poor operation. Even, spending money to expand the force: in our game, the relationship between the difficulty of force management and scale is exponential growth, a slight increase in scale will lead to a surge in difficulty, i.e., a surge in monetary investment. Therefore, no matter how strong the management ability of the rich second generation is, his force will eventually stagnate at a certain scale, and the extra part of this scale, which is slightly larger than his actual management ability, will be compensated by money; and the exponential growth of money required for further expansion will make it unbearable for him. 

Our game will extract 30% of the living expenses of the world's rich second generation. 1% of which will go into our pockets in the form of transaction tax (the rest goes into the pockets of ordinary game players. There are no in-game purchases, only transactions between players, and we charge a 1% transaction tax).

### Sense of Respect: Ordinary People

There cannot only be rich second generation in the game, a large ordinary population is also needed. 
Ordinary people can also gain a sense of respect in our game. But the sense of respect they need is different from that of the rich second generation.
What do they need? 
Praise? 
NO NO NO.Praise makes people happy, but it doesn't make them addicted. 
The name [Respect Need] is not good, it easily causes misunderstandings, making people think that the need for respect is [the need to be praised], thinking that this is a beautiful need. 
In fact, the need for respect is a very cruel and dark need. To respect others, you need to lower your posture; to be respected by others, what you actually want is for others to lower their posture. 
In China, the word [respect] has actually been replaced with a more fitting name long ago, and this name is widely spread: **Show your power**. Respect need, it is more appropriate to call it [**Show your power** need].

In 《Hello Mr. Billionaire》, the protagonist uses money to destroy the hotel manager's arrogance, and then says a classic quote: "I still like you when you were arrogant before, regain that." Then the manager coughs twice and regains his serious expression, and the protagonist laughs heartily. 

This plot is widely praised because it satisfies people's fundamental **Show your power** need for change twice in a short time. 

Persuading a woman of the world to abandon her profession and return to a normal life, or leading a good woman astray; making someone who didn't respect you become respectful, making someone who was high and mighty become subservient. All **Show your power** needs are essentially about changing others. Change includes:

- Sense of Power: You want him to do something, you think he should do that thing, but he doesn't want to, but he does it because of your command.
- Being a Good Teacher: You want him to do something, you think he should do that thing, but he originally didn't want to, but he changes his mind and is willing to do it because of your advice.
- Confidant/Love: You want him to do something, but he doesn't want to, but he does it because you need him to.
- **Show your power**: You want him not to do something, you think he shouldn't do that thing, but he just wants to do it and did it. Now he repents because of your counterattack.
- ...

In our game, hundreds of billions of AI, tens of millions of players. As long as players put in some effort, it is not difficult for every player to become a rich person in the eyes of ordinary AI, recruiting dozens of AI subordinates. 

Each AI has independent thoughts, they are not machines or tools, players cannot control them, they can only issue commands. They will be lazy, disobey commands, and comply outwardly but disobey inwardly; players can achieve initial management through a stick and carrot approach - what is a stick and carrot? Go plant crops for me, if you don't go, I'll beat you, if you go, I'll reward you.

The stick and carrot approach is not foolproof, and cannot avoid outward compliance but inward disobedience, especially with multi-level management. And it cannot avoid harboring resentment and seeking opportunities for revenge - players cannot see the mood of the AI, they can only infer the AI's mood from the AI's behavior. But smart AI will also pretend, hiding their emotions. 

Players can always research stronger management methods, but they can never achieve 100% perfect management. This is also the fun: if it were truly 100%, it would be boring. 

The above content is the principle of achieving a sense of power. In addition to a sense of power, our game can also achieve other respect needs, and their principles are not introduced here. 

Based on this, at least tens of millions of ordinary players will pay. Our game is subscription-based, 100 yuan per person per month. Tens of millions of players will bring in a monthly income of one billion. (Free players can also play, but their strength will be greatly cut, leading to the best option being to join the forces of other players and slack off, and then become envious and subscribe when they see other players having a blast.)

### Summary

Our game will achieve a true sense of respect, attracting the rich second generation, students, white-collar workers, and blue-collar workers.

## Realm of Wind Spirit: The Great Strife

### Background

《Realm of Wind Spirit》, a social open-world game, single-player buy-to-play, 2D (non-pixelated), **Fantasy** worldview. When the game starts, ten thousand planes and one hundred billion NPCs are randomly generated, evolving for a million years (in-game time). After a million years, the player enters the world. There is no plot, no quests, players can do anything. They can explore, build, trade, fight, **Cultivation**, join **Sects**, usurp power, establish **Sects**, wage war... One hundred billion NPCs will act in real time: price changes, world pattern changes, demon path attacks, imperial city prohibitions, tax inspections, conscription... (Note: Performance is not an issue. There are only 100,000 interactive NPCs, and group calculation, fuzzy calculation, and graphics card acceleration are used, which can complete the initial evolution in ten minutes on an 8,000 yuan home computer, and precise real-time calculation is possible after the game starts).

**Realm** division: Three major stages, twelve **Realms**

- Mortal: Mortal **Realm**, **Body Tempering**, Meridian Connecting, Aperture Opening
- Immortal: Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, **Golden Core**, **Nascent Soul**
- True Man: God Transformation, **Void Refinement**, **Dao Unity**, Mahayana Mortal lifespan is a hundred years, **Void Refinement** lifespan is three thousand years. After **Dao Unity**, they are immortal and indestructible. **Void Refinement** is also called Great Emperor, **Dao Unity** is also called Saint. In an era, there is usually only one **Void Refinement** Great Emperor in all the heavens and myriad **Realms**, ten God Transformations, and one hundred **Nascent Souls**. Therefore, a Great Emperor is invincible in his era. Twelve Saints appear in a million years, the twelve Saints are immortal and indestructible, but Saints merge their bodies with the Heavenly Dao, replacing the will of a plane's Heavenly Dao, and the great battle with the Great Emperor will consume the origin of the plane (origin accumulates slowly), and Saints cannot kill Great Emperors, while Great Emperors can threaten **Holy Lands** (the subordinate forces of Saints), so Saints usually do not attack Great Emperors, but will wait for the Great Emperor's lifespan to run out and die naturally. Saints will try their best to use the origin to nurture **Holy Lands** and cultivate their own people from **Holy Lands** to become new Great Emperors, and Saints themselves serve more as deterrence and amplification.

### Great Contention Era: Single-Player Mode

Every hundred thousand years, there is a **Great Contention Era**, in which there will be an opportunity to advance to **Dao Unity** Saint (a flaw in the **Reincarnation Method** of the Heavenly Dao). Therefore, those high-level cultivators (above **Golden Core**) whose lifespans are about to end in the past years will self-seal and awaken when the **Great Contention Era** arrives. In the **Great Contention Era**, top cultivators (God Transformation, **Void Refinement**) will seek to break through to **Dao Unity**, while **Golden Core** and **Nascent Soul** will seek advancement and lifespan extension. Normally, there is usually only one **Void Refinement**, ten God Transformations, and a hundred **Nascent Souls** in the myriad **Realms**, while in the **Great Contention Era**, there are more than thirty awakened **Void Refinements** and more than thirty thousand **Nascent Souls**. They will burn their last lifespan, engage in fierce clashes, create a brilliant era, and the final winner will advance to **Dao Unity**.

In the game, players can see many ancient cultivator relics, including preparations for the **Great Contention Era** and clashes during the **Great Contention Era**. For example:

- The great battle between two **Void Refinement** cultivators will render a plane scorched earth for thousands of miles, without any grass growing. In some small planes, it will even shatter space-time, turning into thousands of time fragments, lưu truyền throughout a million years.
- When high-level cultivators' lifespans are about to end and they self-seal, they will carry all their possessions with them and set up fierce formations, raise fierce beasts, and set up curses around them, turning an area into a dangerous forbidden land, thereby protecting the spiritual coffin for ten thousand years. Players can see many such dangerous places and try to explore and tomb raid.

When creating a new game, it defaults to evolving for a million years. At this time, the tenth **Great Contention Era** has just ended (the Will of the Abyss is the first Saint, and the Original Heavenly Dao is the second Saint, both born at the beginning of heaven and earth, not based on the **Great Contention Era**. 2+10=twelve Saints), and the eleventh **Great Contention Era** is in a hundred thousand years, players will not experience the **Great Contention Era**. In single-player mode, the **Time Flow Rate** is one to sixty. That is, one second on Earth is one minute in the game. High-end computers can enable four times speed, which is one to two hundred forty: one second on Earth is four minutes in the game. But even at one to two hundred forty, it would take more than four hundred years of Earth time to endure a hundred thousand years and enter the **Great Contention Era**. This is impossible to achieve.

When creating a new game, players can choose the evolution time. The **Great Contention Era** lasts for a thousand years, meaning that if you choose an evolution time of nine hundred ninety-nine thousand five hundred years, you can start with the **Great Contention Era**. But in this case, players cannot make preparations for the **Great Contention Era**. At most, they can enter as a **Golden Core**, only as spectators, watching the NPCs contend.

### Great Contention Era: DLC

If you want to play the **Great Contention Era**, you can get the DLC. (DLC: Downloadable Content, an expansion pack that needs to be purchased separately outside the base game.) In the DLC, there will be some specific worlds and starting points, such as [Dark Age of the Tyrant] [Zerg Invasion] [**Great Contention Era**]. When a player purchases the DLC, when creating a new game, they need to choose from options such as [Random World] [Dark Age] [Zerg Invasion] [**Great Contention Era**] (only Random World is available if the DLC is not purchased). After choosing the world, you can choose a starting point. Starting points for [Random World] include: Wanderer, Mortal, Rich Merchant, Immortal (Qi Refining), **Sect** Leader (**Golden Core**). Starting points for [**Great Contention Era**] include: Mortal, Qi Refining, **Golden Core**, **Nascent Soul**, God Transformation, Contemporary **Void Refinement**, Ancient **Void Refinement**, Primordial **Void Refinement**, Saint, Contemporary **Holy Land** Saint Child (**Nascent Soul**).

The **Great Contention Era** and numerous starting points in the DLC are carefully designed, players can try to suppress all monsters and demons as a contemporary Great Emperor, or as an ancient Great Emperor [Once pushed the world horizontally against all enemies, ending with regret against the heavens, for ten thousand years my name was unknown, from today onwards the world will sing], or as a Saint Child, engage in continuous battles and break through three **Realms**. Starting points are essentially players possessing a specific NPC. Random world starting points will possess a random eligible NPC, while each starting point in the **Great Contention Era** DLC will possess a fixed NPC (the world is also fixed at the start). These NPCs have made many preparations for the **Great Contention Era**, and players can use the resources they prepared (including material and non-material resources, non-material resources such as connections and intelligence).

### Great Contention Era: Official Server

After the single-player mode becomes profitable, an online version will be launched. The online version will use a unique official server, with a subscription fee of 100 yuan per person per month, and no in-game purchases. The official server will use a supercomputer as the server, achieving one hundred billion interactive NPCs and real-time calculation of one hundred billion NPCs. The **Time Flow Rate** of the official server is one to one hundred thousand, which means:

- There is a **Great Contention Era** once a year in Earth time.
- A mortal's lifespan of a hundred years corresponds to eight hours of Earth time. A **Void Refinement** Great Emperor's lifespan of three thousand years corresponds to ten days of Earth time. (This not only means an eight-hour game session, but also that your NPC friends' lifespan is only eight hours.)
- The **Great Contention Era** lasts for a thousand years, corresponding to three days of Earth time (the flaw in the **Reincarnation Method** of the Heavenly Dao reaches its maximum in the eight hundredth year, at which point the probability of breaking through to **Dao Unity** is highest, after which it gradually repairs and the breakthrough probability decreases. Generally speaking, someone will break through to **Dao Unity** between the 500th and 800th year, the **Great Contention Era** ends, but the remaining revived individuals will continue to bring turmoil until their lifespans run out, and the world returns to peace).
- The remaining lifespan of revived individuals is 100 to 500 years, corresponding to 8 hours to one and a half days of Earth time.
- One second on Earth is one day in the game. (To avoid [flyers: due to the speed of one to one hundred thousand, the movements of NPCs are too fast to see], the official server will modify many detailed settings, modifying the movement and sleep mechanisms of NPCs.)

The official server does not allow starting points of Qi Refining and above. The official server does not use possession as a starting point. Based on this, there are two types of starting points:

- Infant starting point. Can be reborn into ordinary families, rich merchant families, and other mortal families (free users who don't subscribe can only choose ordinary families). If there are not enough newborns, then queue. (One hundred billion NPCs, one hundred million newborns per year (five minutes on Earth), ordinary starting points will not require queuing. Only advanced starting points may require queuing).
- Adult descent from the heavens. Starting as a mortal in the wilderness.

The **Great Contention Era** in the official server allows players to customize their preparations. In one year of Earth time, players can operate dozens or hundreds of characters, self-seal when their lifespan is about to end, awaken in the **Great Contention Era**, and campaign. (Need to guard against being tomb raided by other players or NPCs.) The accumulation of the past year burns its last glory in the **Great Contention Era**, and after becoming a **Dao Unity** Saint, one can be immortal and indestructible, merging with the Heavenly Dao of a Realm, this Realm turns into a **Holy Land**, and also exists forever. Saints control the power of rules within the **Holy Land**, and can determine life and death and reverse yin and yang. Players who do not become Saints can also have a lasting impact on the world. Forces established by **Nascent Soul** cultivators often can exist for a hundred thousand years (in-game time). Players ascend to **Nascent Soul**, manage their forces, and then self-seal or die of old age, after which they create new characters and forget history. Months later, they are surprised to find that their new character has encountered trouble, being oppressed by a powerful force, and that force is actually one they established when their old character was at the **Nascent Soul** stage, and they will often worship their old character - the player's death is not the end of the world, when the Sect Leader dies, the NPC elders and disciples will try their best to continue the **Sect**, with the Great Elder, or the Sect Leader's son, or the Saint Child as the new Sect Leader. Players cannot specify being reborn into their old force. But they can try to communicate with NPCs, establish tokens or other methods, and then their new character can [recognize relatives] in the old force. In this way, players can make many characters they established in a year of Earth time belong to the same force, plus the help of NPCs, thus increasing the success rate in the **Great Contention Era**; and try to ensure that [even if they fail, their force will not be destroyed, and they will wait for the next **Great Contention Era** to contend again].

If players are tired, they can not play for several months. When players want to play, the **Sect** token from ten thousand years ago is still valid, and the Sect Leader a hundred generations later may welcome you emotionally, believing that the ancestor is not dead and has been worshipped for generations; or they may have long since ignored you, and now don't want you to take their place, so they entertain you warmly while secretly assassinating you; or the **Sect** may have been destroyed, leaving only a pile of ruins.

### Summary

The **Great Contention Era** is a core highlight and climax of the game. Single-player mode, DLC, and official server each have different selling points for the **Great Contention Era**. In single-player mode, the **Great Contention Era** is mainly used to build the background of the twelve Saints, allow players to witness shocking relics, and allow players to explore forbidden lands. In the DLC, the **Great Contention Era** is mainly used to allow players to try to participate in the **Great Contention Era**, contend for the position of **Dao Unity**, and stir up the winds and clouds of the world. In the official server, the **Great Contention Era** is mainly used for players to personally prepare, manage their forces, and participate in the **Great Contention Era**.

### In-Game RMB Transactions

The game supports RMB transactions in-game. Players can top up their game accounts, and then players can trade with each other. We charge a 1% tax.

The **Holy Land** under the Original Heavenly Dao is the [**Equal Holy Land Trading House**], where killing is prohibited, and violators are immediately executed. Saints control the rules within the **Holy Land**, and can determine life and death with a single thought. The **Equal Holy Land Trading House** widely accepts people to enter, but entry and staying require payment, and the price is not cheap. The **Equal Holy Land Trading House** provides proxy trading services and accepts two currencies: **Spirit Stones & Dao Stones**. People can post sell/buy orders here, requiring a tax of five ten-thousandths when posting, and a tax of one percent after the transaction is completed. In particular, **Spirit Stones** can be used to buy **Dao Stones**, and **Dao Stones** can be used to buy **Spirit Stones**. Aside from trading, the only way to obtain **Dao Stones** is through topping up, and the only way to consume them is through redemption: one-to-one exchange for RMB (or equivalent USD). The **Equal Holy Land Trading House** also provides storage services, where stored items are almost absolutely safe. But it requires a considerable storage fee. After a trade is completed, the trade proceeds are automatically stored, and a storage fee needs to be paid when picking up the goods. If not picked up, when the storage fee exceeds the estimated value of the trade proceeds, the trade proceeds are confiscated. The services of the **Equal Holy Land Trading House** are based on tokens, not people. A token is a string of password, and anyone holding this token can take away the items stored under this token.

Based on the above rules, players can trade items with each other using RMB. We will not generate any items or interfere with the behavior of NPCs. All resources are collected and produced by NPCs and players according to the world rules. NPCs may buy **Dao Stones**, but the reason is usually for preservation, or to buy some valuable items that are not sold with **Spirit Stones**. In a few cases, they may buy them on a sudden whim.

The reason for this is: for such a free open world, RMB trading cannot be prohibited. Instead of letting RMB trading grow wild, it is better to provide an official platform that can both stabilize reputation and prevent players from worrying about the other party not delivering in-game after offline payment, and collect taxes for profit. The vast transaction volume of players will generate a lot of income from the 1% tax.

### Force Eternal Life

After playing more than ten characters, most players will choose to build and operate a force with NPCs. Only a few players will choose to join other players' forces or go solo. In general games, the character is the player. In our official server game, the [force] is more like the player. The mountain-protecting formation ensures that forces are difficult to be instantly destroyed: even a **Void Refinement** Great Emperor cannot destroy a **Nascent Soul** force that has activated its mountain-protecting formation within a day of Earth time (unless the mountain-protecting formation is not activated and is ambushed). Teleportation formations ensure that forces are difficult to be destroyed: under the mountain-protecting formation, even if they encounter an invincible enemy, they can retain the core strength of the force (elders, inner disciples, **Spirit Stones & Dao Stones**, **Artifacts**), teleport to other planes, and make a comeback. (The mountain-protecting formation consumes a huge amount of **Spirit Stones & Dao Stones** per second after activation, so it cannot be activated constantly. But external reconnaissance and internal supervision can be strengthened to avoid being ambushed by external enemies and destroyed by spies.)

Players will usually have their forces store an expensive pill: **Realm** Fast Ascension Pill. It can allow a low-level cultivator to quickly break through to a high-level **Realm** in a short period of time. Players can subscribe to game notifications (free), set notification levels, and receive notifications via text message, email, etc., when an event reaches or exceeds the level. For example, players can subscribe to the [Survival] level, so that when they encounter a strong enemy attack, they will be notified. At this time, players can go online, create a wilderness adult character, join their force with a token, and use the **Realm** Fast Ascension Pill to quickly obtain a high-combat body and act as the interim Sect Leader. NPCs will spontaneously manage the forces, and it doesn't matter if players don't go online for two months on weekdays. An experienced player can easily build a **Nascent Soul** force through the efforts of dozens of generations of people in the game. But God Transformation is extremely difficult, and many players work hard their whole lives and still cannot reach God Transformation.

NPCs conform to human nature and are not players' slaves. If the player's educational methods are not good, then if the player doesn't go online for two months, a [charismatic NPC leader] may appear within the force, causing other NPCs to respect him instead of the player; after the player returns, they will outwardly comply but inwardly defy, or even assassinate the player. A simple and effective educational method is: forced worship. Require NPCs to worship the ancestor (the player's first character) every ten years (one hour on Earth). This can greatly reduce the NPC rebellion rate, but it cannot completely avoid it. To fundamentally solve the problem, players need to think about other methods, such as establishing a supervision department. There are no options such as [forced worship] [establish a supervision department] in the game. In the first generation of the official server, players achieve these operations by using [architecture + proposal + punishment]. The format of a proposal is [when at a certain time (or now), you do something], and architecture exists as a kind of memory, implementing [when A happens, you change the architecture to X. When B happens and the architecture is X, you do something]. When NPCs don't obey orders, players can attack NPCs as punishment; when NPCs obey orders, players can give items as rewards. I know this rule is not perfect, but to ensure the free actions of AI, this is the only way for now. In the second generation of the official server, I will make some changes, enhancing the intelligence of NPCs to make them understand players' difficulties and think and verify solutions; and add some atomic emotional expressions, so that players only need to [let the second character lead the elders, set up a monument for the ancestor themselves, worship, make "moved" speeches, and make "angry" speeches to the elders when they don't act], so that the elders will understand that they need to worship. (The reason why this scheme is not used in the first generation is: the current first generation scheme is mature and can implement psychological AI NPCs in my research. Although the second generation scheme seems better, I am not sure about many detailed algorithms, and more research is needed, and it is best to develop the second generation on the basis of the first generation AI after the first generation AI is developed.)

### Conclusion

The single-player mode and online game mode have no technical differences, but the player experience is completely different. In single-player mode, the player is more like the character, and the force established by the player is only used to produce resources and defend territory. In online game mode, the player is more like the force, and the player's many characters burn their lives for the eternal life of the force, or pursue that slim chance of **Dao Unity**. Only after reaching **Dao Unity** can one truly experience the world leisurely as a character (can use the life rule to keep a new character's lifespan full within the **Holy Land**, so that as long as this character's time outside does not exceed their lifespan, they will not die from old age, and their lifespan will be refilled every time they return to the **Holy Land**. However, this will consume some of the **Holy Land**'s origin, which is fine for personal use, but cannot be promoted as a service to the public; nor can it support cultivators of too high a **Realm** (the higher the **Realm**, the greater the consumption of the **Holy Land**'s origin to replenish their lifespan. **Nascent Soul** and below are fine)). A million players, only one person reaches **Dao Unity** per year, how difficult!

Therefore, the online game will not make the single-player game boring, nor will the single-player game make the online game boring. The two do not constitute a competitive relationship, can both be profitable, and even promote each other: single-player players want to go to the online game to personally prepare for the **Great Contention Era**, and online game players want to go to the single-player game to live a leisurely wandering life. (Single-player mode does not need to consider lifespan. Even a mortal, at a **Time Flow Rate** of one to sixty, has a lifespan of more than a year of Earth time, assuming the player plays eight hours a day, it would take four years of playing on Earth for a mortal's lifespan to run out, not to mention increasing **Realm** to increase lifespan. And in single-player mode, **Realm** advancement is also more convenient, reaching **Nascent Soul** in dozens of hours in single-player mode, which takes dozens of generations of characters to reach in online game mode. Online game is a real and cruel **Cultivation** world, the difficulty gap between stages is equal to the population gap: thirty times (thirty Foundation Establishment cultivators produce one **Golden Core**, thirty **Golden Cores** produce one **Nascent Soul**. This includes NPCs, and NPCs are not as intelligent as players, so most of the 29 who didn't advance are NPCs, so for pure players, the difficulty is around ten times). And single-player mode is like a wish-fulfillment story, conforming to the flow state curve, the difficulty gap between stages is equal to the flow state time gap: 1.6 times (Foundation Establishment to **Golden Core** is twenty-five hours, **Golden Core** to **Nascent Soul** is forty hours, **Nascent Soul** to God Transformation is sixty-four hours)).

                    <p>Billions of AI-NPCs, procedural worlds, initial evolution over a million years, dynasties rise and fall even without player intervention - a true virtual civilization.</p>
                    <p>Thriving financial and trade systems, unlike the social isolation of Dwarf Fortress or the loneliness of Minecraft.</p>
                    <p>Billions of NPCs based on survival needs and independent wills, without the rigid soldiers of Civilization or the inflexible AI of Kenshi.</p>
                    <p>Seamless map, flow state curve, immersive experience, without the fragmented scenes of Mount & Blade or the fodder experience of EVE Online.</p>

                        <p>In Realm of Wind Spirit, the player is not the protagonist but one among many. Each NPC is the protagonist of their own story - from supreme immortals to common mortals - all acting according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Fluctuating prices, dynasty changes, immortal falls, and mortal ascensions continue to evolve even when the player is absent. The player enters a truly virtual society, not a static world of structures.</p>

                        <p>Mystical worldview. Thousands of worlds, billions of NPCs. The entire world can operate and dynasties can change even without player intervention. Cultural systems of various factions evolve naturally, forming a genuine cultivation society rather than a cultivation opera.</p>

                        <p>When an AI is placed in the wild, driven by hunger, it will gather fruits to eat, collect wood to build a house, and plant farms. When encountering enemies, it will hide in its house.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>AI must sustain itself. Its hunger meter doesn't reset, its money doesn't refresh - it must have its own means of livelihood even when the player isn't watching.</p>

                        <h4>Persuasion Over Command</h4>
                        <p>When we control a new character and suggest an AI follow us, it won't listen. If we attack or restrain it, then suggest it follow us, it will indicate compliance. After being released, it will follow us but may escape at any time.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>When establishing a faction, you must realize: AI entities are not pawns; they have their own thoughts. Small tip: a combination of force and rewards is a simple and effective management approach.</p>

                        <p>We bring an AI to the city, buy high-quality food, and feed it. It expresses great happiness. Then we take the AI to the wilderness and set it free. The AI no longer builds houses or farms but collects some food and then begins to move around searching for the city. It remembers the delicious food in the city.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>AI will have short-term and long-term memory, capable of simple learning like cats and dogs, rather than remaining rigid and foolish.</p>

                        <p>If a merchant AI's goods are plundered by pirates, that merchant might break down and become a pirate; if a monster hunter AI is injured and finds healing medicine too expensive, that hunter might switch to alchemy. Many AIs work in specialized fields, cooperating through social trade, with daily trade volume in trade centers reaching billions, prices determined by the market. This also gives rise to a group of speculative AIs, buying low and selling high for profit.</p>

When mortals enter a sect, they almost sever ties with their parents, considering the sect as their family. If your status is an inner disciple or higher, your children automatically become sect members.

                                    - Company aspect: The sect has missions that members must complete.

                                    Manage mortals and sects, with vast territories. However, the relationship between sects and dynasties is complex, with the following exceptions:
                                    - Some sects have affiliated mortal cities (mini-dynasties). City lords are self-governing, only providing tribute, accepting sect protection, and facilitating sect activities (such as recruitment, or some less public affairs like finding cultivation vessels).
                                    - Powerful sects influence multiple dynasties (like multinational corporations, rich enough to challenge nations), but a sect's power within a nearby dynasty will almost inevitably lead to conflict with its original dynasty.
                                    - Even if a sect's power surpasses a dynasty, the sect's headquarters will still occupy a small area (compared to the dynasty's territory) and will still nominally belong to a dynasty. However, the sect will secretly control the emperor and ministers, thereby controlling the dynasty.

                                    Overview: Demonic path alliance, robbing and plundering.
                                    Social status: Super first-class power, consistently possessing six or more Nascent Soul cultivators. Righteous sects are relatively tolerant of their members, not easily eradicating them; Demonic Alliance members often have public headquarters, while non-Alliance demon cultivators must wander homelessness. The Ten Thousand Worlds Convention usually invites Demonic Alliance representatives to attend.
                                    Internal system: One hegemon, many powers. The hegemon is lifelong, can be challenged; leaders of Nascent Soul-level powers automatically become powerful masters, with deliberation and information rights; other members need to pay protection fees.
                                    Cultural characteristics: Members are mostly church-based. Church characteristics: loose entry and exit, numerous outer disciples; information scarcity upward, extreme authority downward. Under righteous sect suppression, the church model facilitates survival and reproduction. A few powers rely on Demonic Alliance protection to change to the sect system, but all six powers are churches.
                                    Core members:
                                    - Death Church: One-hit kill.
                                    - Phantom Church: You struggle and cry out in a barrier, but passersby are unaware.
                                    - Seven Kill Church: Occupy transmission arrays, kill everyone who comes.
                                    - Nightmare Church: Wander in the wild, can't be warned by compasses.
                                    - Flood Church: Random transmission, steamroll everything. Wherever they go, nothing grows.
                                    - Shadow Church: Three years without action, then feast for three years. Spies everywhere, only rob the most valuable goods.

                            The Great Strife Era occurs once every ten thousand years, during which an opportunity to advance to Dao Integration sainthood appears (a breach in the Heavenly Dao cycle).<br>
                            When the world first began, there were two innate Great Dao Saints: the Primordial Heavenly Dao and the Abyss Will. With the addition of the Great Strife Era's once-in-ten-thousand-years posterior Dao Integration Saints, over a million years, the Ten Thousand Worlds have produced twelve Saints in total.
                        </p>

                        <p class="content-text">
                            In the past, those high-level cultivators whose lifespans were nearing their end would self-seal, waiting to awaken when the Great Strife Era arrived.
                            Normally, the Ten Thousand Worlds typically have only one Ethereal Void, ten Divine Transformations, and a hundred Nascent Souls, but during the Great Strife Era, over thirty Ethereal Voids and over thirty thousand Nascent Souls awaken. They will burn their remaining lifespans, engage in intense confrontations, create a brilliant era, and the final winner will advance to Dao Integration.
                        </p>

                        <p class="content-text">
                            Based on the Great Strife Era, many ancient ruins can be seen in the game:
                            The battle between two Ethereal Void Grand Emperors can leave a plane scorched for thousands of miles, with not a blade of grass growing. In some small planes, they even shatter space-time, turning it into millions of time fragments that persist for a million years.
                            When high-level cultivators' lifespans are nearly exhausted and they self-seal, they bring all their possessions with them and arrange terrible arrays, breed fierce beasts, and set curses around them, turning an area into a dangerous forbidden zone to protect their spirit coffin through ten thousand years. Players can see many such dangerous lands and can attempt to explore and tomb raid.
                        </p>

                                            Back when I was at Golden Core, I established the Seven Kill Sect in Right Formless, gaining fame, but with limited land and many people, there was no room for expansion.<br>
                                            At that time, to the left was Golden Core T1, to the right was Golden Core C Sect, to the front was Nascent Soul A Sect, and to the back was Nascent Soul B Sect.<br>
                                            T1, a legendary genius from a Holy Land, leading a group of prodigies, with the potential for Nascent Soul, was just lacking allies.<br>
                                            I wanted to join them, but T1 fiercely attacked A Sect, was defeated and scattered. I then took over their territory and recruited T2—a capable prodigy under T1, also with Nascent Soul potential.<br>
                                            We respected A Sect as the leader, offered gold for territory, A Sect agreed; after we finished relocating and began construction, A Sect changed their mind. We were furious but dared not speak out, yielding the land and returning.<br>
                                            During the Nascent Soul expedition, A Sect called on us for assistance, promising the Left Formless. We tightened our belts, exhausted our resources, spared no effort, and supplied the front line. Victory came, but A Sect reneged again, compensating with
                                            just a few immortal pills. We smiled, but the fire of revenge was already burning in our hearts.<br>
                                            I allied with C Sect, forming a union. When Nascent Soul conflicts arose again, A Sect invited us to assist; C Sect sent envoys to B Sect, B Sect agreed to supply resources and backstab A Sect, I deliberated and agreed.<br>
                                            C Sect wanted to lead the alliance, actively engaging in diplomacy and military affairs. I delegated command authority, but their tactics were a mess, resulting in several major defeats. I took back command and achieved great victories.<br>
                                            Amid consecutive victories, A Sect suddenly launched multiple surprise attacks on our supply lines, with accurate intelligence, targeting only Seven Kill's weak points without involving C Sect.<br>
                                            I realized with shock: C Sect had betrayed us, probably out of jealousy for my superior tactics. After deep contemplation, I decided to apologize, stating that C Sect had paved the way with sacrifices, and I shouldn't have taken the military achievements. Simultaneously, I boldly declared: I won't force everyone to forgive me, but currently there are spies, and I don't want those harboring resentment to hide. Everyone can leave or stay voluntarily; for those leaving, I'll fully compensate their past investments in the alliance. Let's part amicably, and please don't aid A Sect anymore.<br>
                                            Earth-shattering, almost all of C Sect left, leaving Seven Kill to fight A Sect alone. Gritting our teeth to hold on, united in purpose, everyone donated resources, non-combatants also cultivated techniques to join the battle. Territories continued to fall, but we fought with increasing fervor: magical treasures produced one after another, new soldiers graduating batch after batch, seventeen Golden Core dao embryos formed, T2 entered Nascent Soul. We counterattacked and exterminated A Sect, liquidated C Sect, allied with B Sect, and Seven Kill reigned in Formless.

                                            <p>
                                                Conventionally, top resources are all seized by Grand Emperors.<br>
                                                In the current era, there has been no emperor for three hundred years, so the various Divine Transformation powers are wealthy, collectively accumulating nearly a thousand Nascent Soul dao embryos. However, daily conflicts remain limited to Foundation Establishment scale, with only about a hundred Nascent Soul cultivators publicly known in the Ten Thousand Worlds. The Nascent Soul dao embryos are already stirring.<br>
                                                Among the twelve Holy Lands, three have Divine Transformation, with six others in the outside world: ABCDE and you. Finally, chaotic warfare erupts. You battle A and exterminate it. After recuperating, you fight B and exterminate it as well. CDE join forces, and you decide to face them in a decisive battle, emerging victorious, unifying the Ten Thousand Worlds (outside the Holy Lands).<br>
                                                However, internal turmoil arises; demonic cultivators plunder your territories, and the remnants of AB and surrendered forces from CDE take advantage of the chaos to rebel, conducting guerrilla warfare to destroy workshops and warehouses.<br>
                                                You suppress and eradicate the demonic cultivators, but the demonic cultivators use new Nascent Soul dao embryos. You suppress and kill them again, and they revive again.<br>
                                                You wonder with shock: where do they get so many Nascent Soul dao embryos?<br>
                                                In reality, the Merchant Alliance and Holy Lands are supporting the demonic cultivators; none of them want unification. Unification leads to bandit suppression, which is disadvantageous to demonic cultivators; unification means no war casualties, insufficient demand, falling prices, disadvantageous to merchants; unification means people respect you instead of the Holy Lands. (Although both are Divine Transformation, the Holy Lands have no need to compete with you. After you turn to dust in a thousand years, the Holy Lands will still stand. Therefore, the Holy Lands allow people to respect you, but they don't prefer it, so they want to irritate you at a small cost.)<br>
                                                With demonic cultivators coming endlessly, your logistics are strained, and further battles risk destruction. You withdraw in time, ceding territories, allowing ABCDE to re-establish their nations. You retain five hundred planes. ABCDE agree, and peace is reached. You continue to suppress demonic cultivators. After this suppression ends, the demonic cultivators stop attacking.<br>
                                                After settling the five hundred planes, you design spy talismans, letting many NPCs become spies, infiltrating ABCDE, merchants, demonic cultivators, and even some Holy Lands. The spies steal intelligence; some become civil officials with voting rights, thus influencing other powers' decisions. Some spies even become generals of other powers, responsible for commanding battles.<br>
                                                When the time is right, you spring the trap. You launch full-scale warfare again, destroying all non-Holy Land super first-class powers, unifying the Ten Thousand Worlds. The Holy Lands remain silent. (Super first-class: powers or alliances with Divine Transformation or six or more Nascent Souls.)

                                    <p class="rune-desc">Realm of Wind Spirit has a built-in programming language with syntax more similar to natural language than Python. Runes have many functions: automatic combat, automatic exploration, automatic mining, automatic selling, automatic faction management, custom positions, custom cultivation methods, etc.</p>
                                    <p class="rune-desc">To implement cognitive filtering, Realm of Wind Spirit contains many built-in runes, and players typically don't perceive the existence of runes. For example, the Yin-Yang method and Reincarnation method are both written with runes, not code. (Of course, players can also use runes to invent new methods and new panels.)</p>
                                    <p class="rune-desc">Many panels are also written with runes, such as the unified storage panel: the left list contains items like storage rings, boxes, trading center deposits, corpses in front, etc., and the right side is a grid of items in the selected entry. The game provides this panel directly to players, but players can manually view this panel's source runes, edit and reset them. The game backend only defines independent panels for various items in C# (e.g., a separate storage ring panel), while the unified storage panel is defined using runes. But players can use the unified storage panel normally even without knowing about runes. This is cognitive filtering.</p>

                                        <p>With the Pseudo-Saint Path, complexity will never be a disadvantage of Realm of Wind Spirit, but rather an advantage—players can start with simple special cases and progressively explore deeper gameplay. In fact, in our design philosophy, <span class="highlight-text">the more complex the game, the better</span>, because complexity brings endless possibilities, while cognitive filtering ensures this complexity doesn't become an obstacle for new players.</p>

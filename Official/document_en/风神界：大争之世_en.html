                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>"Fengshen World," a social open-world game, single-player buy-out model, 2D (non-pixel), fantasy worldview.</p>
                <p>At the start of the game, 10,000 planes and 10 billion NPCs are randomly generated and evolve for a million years (in-game time). After a million years, players enter the world.</p>
                <p>No storyline, no missions, players can do anything. They can explore, build, trade, fight, cultivate, join sects, usurp power, establish sects, launch wars... Ten billion NPCs will act in real-time: prices change, world patterns shift, demonic attacks, imperial prohibitions, tax inspections, conscription...</p>
                <p class="technical-note">Performance is not an issue. Only 100,000 interactable NPCs, and using group calculation, fuzzy calculation, and GPU acceleration, the game can complete the initial evolution within ten minutes on an 8,000 yuan home computer, and can perform real-time precise calculations after the game starts.</p>

                <p>Mortals have a lifespan of one hundred years, Void Refinement cultivators three thousand years. After Dao Merging, one is undying and indestructible.</p>
                <p>Void Refinement is also called Great Emperor, Dao Merging is also called Saint. In one era, the myriad worlds usually have only one Void Refinement Great Emperor, ten Divine Transformation, and one hundred Yuan Ying. Thus, the Great Emperor is invincible in his era.</p>
                <p>A million years produces twelve Saints; the twelve Saints are undying and indestructible, but Saints merge with the Dao, replacing a plane's Heavenly Dao will, and battles with Great Emperors will consume the plane's origin (origin accumulates slowly), and Saints cannot kill Great Emperors, while Great Emperors can threaten Sacred Lands (the Saint's subordinate forces), so Saints typically won't act against Great Emperors but wait for their natural death as their lifespan expires. Saints try to nurture Sacred Lands with origin, cultivating their own people to become new Great Emperors, with the Saints themselves serving more as deterrents and amplifiers.</p>

                <h2>The Age of Great Contention: Single-Player Mode</h2>
                <p>Once every 100,000 years comes the Age of Great Contention, where there's an opportunity to advance to a Dao Merging Saint (a break in the Heavenly Dao cycle).</p>
                <p>Therefore, those high-level cultivators from the past (Golden Core and above) with nearly depleted lifespans would self-seal and wait to awaken when the Age of Great Contention arrives.</p>
                <p>In the Age of Great Contention, top cultivators (Divine Transformation, Void Refinement) seek to break through to Dao Merging, while Golden Core and Yuan Ying seek advancement and life extension.</p>
                <p>Normally, the myriad worlds usually have only one Void Refinement, ten Divine Transformation, and a hundred Yuan Ying, but in the Age of Great Contention, over thirty Void Refinement and over 30,000 Yuan Ying awaken. They will burn their remaining lifespan, engage in fierce confrontations, create a brilliant era, and the final winner will advance to Dao Merging.</p>
                
                <div class="concept-box">
                    <h3>Relic Exploration</h3>
                    <p>In the game, players can see many relics of ancient cultivators, including preparations for the Age of Great Contention and confrontations, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Battles between two Void Refinement cultivators can leave a plane barren for a thousand miles without a blade of grass; in some small planes, they may even shatter time and space, creating millions of time fragments that spread over a million years.</li>
                        <li>When high-level cultivators with depleted lifespans self-seal, they bring their entire wealth, arranging deadly arrays, breeding deadly beasts, setting curses, turning an area into a dangerous forbidden zone to protect their spirit coffin through ten thousand years. Players can see many such perilous lands and try to explore them, looting tombs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>When starting a new game, it defaults to evolving for a million years. At this time, the tenth Age of Great Contention has just ended (Abyss Will as the first Saint, Primal Heavenly Dao as the second Saint, both born at the birth of heaven and earth, not based on the Age of Great Contention. 2+10=twelve Saints), the eleventh Age of Great Contention is 100,000 years later, players can't experience the Age of Great Contention.</p>
                
                <div class="technical-note">
                    <h4>Time Flow Rate</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In single-player mode, the time flow rate is 1:60. That is, one second on Earth equals one minute in-game.</li>
                        <li>High-performance computers can run at 4x speed, making it 1:240: one second on Earth equals four minutes in-game.</li>
                        <li>But even at 1:240, to wait through 100,000 years and enter the Age of Great Contention would require over 400 years of Earth time. It's impossible to achieve.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>When starting a new game, players can choose the evolution time. The Age of Great Contention lasts a thousand years, so if you choose an evolution time of 999,500 years, you can start with the Age of Great Contention.</p>
                <p>But in this case, players can't prepare for the Age of Great Contention. At most, they enter as a Golden Core, only able to watch as spectators as NPCs contend for supremacy.</p>

                <p>The Age of Great Contention in the DLC with its numerous starting points is carefully designed. Players can try as contemporary Great Emperors to suppress all demons and monsters, as ancient Great Emperors to "Once swept all enemies in the world, harbored hatred while hard-fighting heaven, no one knew my name for ten thousand ages, after today the world will sing," or as Holy Sons to fight consecutively, breaking through three major realms.</p>
                <p>Starting points essentially involve players possessing certain NPCs. Random world starting points possess random NPCs meeting the conditions, while each starting point in the Age of Great Contention DLC possesses a fixed NPC (the world is also fixed at the start). These NPCs have all made many preparations for the Age of Great Contention, and players can use their prepared resources (including material and non-material resources, non-material resources like connections, intelligence).</p>

            <section id="official-server">
                <h2>The Age of Great Contention: Official Server</h2>
                <p>After the single-player mode becomes profitable, an online version will be released. The online version uses a unique official server, subscription-based at 100 yuan per person per month, no in-app purchases.</p>
                <p>The official server uses supercomputers as servers, implementing ten billion interactable NPCs with real-time calculations.</p>
                
                <div class="concept-box">
                    <h3>Official Server Time Flow Rate</h3>
                    <p>The official server's time flow rate is 1:100,000, meaning:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One Age of Great Contention every Earth year.</li>
                        <li>A mortal's hundred-year lifespan corresponds to eight Earth hours. A Void Refinement Great Emperor's three-thousand-year lifespan corresponds to ten Earth days. <span class="tip">This not only means an eight-hour game session but also that your NPC friends' lifespans are only eight hours.</span></li>
                        <li>The Age of Great Contention lasts a thousand years, corresponding to three Earth days (the Heavenly Dao cycle break reaches its maximum in the 800th year, with the highest probability of breaking through to Dao Merging, then gradually repairs, with decreasing breakthrough probability. Typically, someone breaks through to Dao Merging between the 500th-800th years, ending the Age of Great Contention, but the remaining revived ones continue to bring turbulence until their lifespans are exhausted, and the world returns to calm)</li>
                        <li>Revived ones' remaining lifespans are 100 to 500 years, corresponding to 8 hours to one and a half Earth days.</li>
                        <li>One Earth second equals one game day. <span class="tip">To avoid the "flying person" problem (due to the 1:100,000 speed, NPC actions are too fast to see clearly), the official server will modify many detailed settings, changing NPC movement and sleep mechanisms.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>The official server doesn't allow Qi Refining or above starting points.</p>
                <p>The official server doesn't start with possession. Based on this, there are two types of starting points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Infant Starting Point</strong>: Can be reincarnated into commoner, rich merchant, and other mortal families (unpaid free users can only choose commoner). If newborns are insufficient, queue up. <span class="tip">Ten billion NPCs, one billion newborns each year (Earth 5 minutes), commoner starting points won't require queuing. Higher-level starting points might require queuing</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Heaven-Descended Adult</strong>: Start as a mortal in the wild.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>The Age of Great Contention in Official Server: Custom Preparation</h3>
                    <p>The Age of Great Contention in the official server allows players to customize preparations.</p>
                    <p>In one Earth year, players can operate dozens or hundreds of characters, self-sealing when lifespans are nearly depleted, awakening and contending in the Age of Great Contention. <span class="tip">Must guard against tomb-looting by other players or NPCs</span></p>
                    <p>The accumulation of the past year burns its final glory in the Age of Great Contention; after becoming a Dao Merging Saint, one can be undying and indestructible, merging with a plane's Heavenly Dao, with the plane becoming a Sacred Land, also eternally existing. Within the Sacred Land, Saints control the power of rules, can determine life and death, reverse Yin and Yang.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Players who don't become Saints can still influence the world for a long time. Forces established by Yuan Ying cultivators often exist for 100,000 years (game time). Players can reach Yuan Ying, manage forces, then self-seal or die at the end of their lifespan, then create new characters, forgetting history. Months later, they surprisingly discover their new characters encounter trouble, being oppressed by a powerful force, and that force turns out to be one established by their old characters—they regularly worship the player's old character—player death isn't the end of the world; when a sect leader dies, NPC elders and disciples strive to continue the sect, with a grand elder, the sect leader's child, or a holy son becoming the new sect leader.</p>
                <p>Players can't specify reincarnation into their old forces. But they can try communicating with NPCs, establishing tokens or other plans, then have their new characters "recognize relatives" at old forces. This way, players can have many characters established over an Earth year belong to the same force, and with NPC help, increase their success rate in the Age of Great Contention; and try to ensure "even if we fail, our force shouldn't perish, waiting for the next Age of Great Contention to contend again."</p>
                
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h3>Game Persistent Experience</h3>
                    <p>If players get tired, they can stop playing for months. When players want to play again, sect tokens from ten thousand years ago are still valid, and the sect leader a hundred generations later might:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Welcome you emotionally, believing through generations of worship that the ancestor isn't dead</li>
                        <li>Have long ignored you, now not wanting you to take his position, cordially entertaining you while secretly assassinating you</li>
                        <li>The sect has been destroyed, leaving only ruins</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Summary: Game Modes</h2>

                <p>Single-player mode, DLC, and the official server each have different selling points for the Age of Great Contention.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In single-player mode, the Age of Great Contention mainly builds the background of the twelve Saints, lets players witness impressive relics, and explore forbidden areas.</li>
                    <li>In the DLC, the Age of Great Contention mainly lets players try participating in the Age of Great Contention, contending for the Dao Merging position, stirring world storms.</li>
                    <li>In the official server, the Age of Great Contention mainly lets players personally prepare, manage forces, participate in the Age of Great Contention.</li>

                <h2>In-Game RMB Trading</h2>
                <p>The game supports RMB trading. Players can recharge their game accounts, then trade with other players. We take a 1% tax.</p>
                
                <div class="concept-box">
                    <h3>Equality Sacred Land</h3>
                    <p>The Primal Heavenly Dao's subordinate Sacred Land is the "Equality Sacred Land," where killing and fighting are forbidden, violators are immediately executed. Saints control the rules within Sacred Lands, a thought can determine life and death.</p>
                    <p>The Equality Sacred Land widely accepts people, but entry and stay require payment, and prices are not cheap.</p>

                <div class="concept-box">
                    <h3>Proxy Trading System</h3>
                    <p>The Equality Sacred Land provides proxy trading services, accepting two currencies: spirit stones and Dao stones. People can post sell/buy orders, requiring a tax of 0.05% when posting, and a tax of 1% after transaction. Specifically, spirit stones can be used to purchase Dao stones, and Dao stones to purchase spirit stones.</p>
                    <p>Besides trading, the only output channel for Dao stones is recharging, and the only consumption channel is redemption: 1:1 exchange for RMB (or equivalent USD).</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="concept-box">
                    <h3>Storage Service</h3>
                    <p>The Equality Sacred Land also provides storage services, where stored items are almost absolutely safe. But it requires substantial custody fees.</p>
                    <p>After a trade is completed, the trade proceeds are automatically stored, and custody fees must be paid when collecting. If not collected, when the custody fee exceeds the estimated value of the trade proceeds, the proceeds are confiscated.</p>
                    <p>The Equality Sacred Land's service recognizes tokens, not people. The token is a string of passwords, anyone holding this token can take away items stored under it.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Based on the above rules, players can trade resources using RMB.</p>
                <p>We won't generate any resources or intervene with NPC behavior. All resources are collected and produced by NPCs and players according to world rules.</p>
                <p>NPCs may purchase Dao stones, but usually to preserve value, or to purchase some precious items with no spirit stone sell orders. In rare cases, they might buy on a whim.</p>
                
                <div class="technical-note">
                    <p>The reason for this is: for such a free open world, RMB trading cannot be prohibited. Rather than letting RMB trading grow wildly, it's better to provide an official platform, both stabilizing reputation—avoiding players worrying about paying offline and not receiving in-game items—and profiting from taxes. With massive player transaction flow, the 1% tax income will be substantial.</p>

                    <h3>Force Protection Mechanism</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mountain Protection Grand Array</strong>: Ensures forces can't be instantly destroyed. Even a Void Refinement Great Emperor can't annihilate a Yuan Ying force with activated mountain protection grand array in one Earth day (unless the protection array wasn't activated during a sneak attack).</li>
                        <li><strong>Teleportation Array</strong>: Ensures forces can't be wiped out. Under the mountain protection array, even facing an invincible enemy, the force's core strength (elders, inner disciples, spirit stones, pills, magical treasures) can be preserved, teleported to other planes, and make a comeback.</li>
                        <li class="tip">After the mountain protection grand array activates, it consumes massive spirit stones per second, so it can't be constantly active. But external reconnaissance and internal monitoring can be strengthened to avoid external sneak attacks and sabotage by spies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>Players typically have their forces store an expensive pill: realm quick-rise pill. It allows a low-level cultivator to rapidly break through to a certain high level in a short time.</p>
                <p>Players can subscribe to game notifications (free), set notification levels, and when events at or above that level occur, they'll be notified through mobile text, email, etc. For example, players can subscribe to the "Existence" level, so they'll be notified when strong enemies attack. Then players can log in, create wilderness adult characters, join their forces with tokens, and use realm quick-rise pills to quickly gain high combat power bodies, proxy sect leaders.</p>
                <p>NPCs will operate forces on their own; normally it's fine even if players don't log in for two months.</p>
                <p>An experienced player can build a Yuan Ying force after dozens of generations of effort in-game. But Divine Transformation is extremely difficult, many players can't reach Divine Transformation even after lifelong efforts.</p>

                    <h3>NPC Management Challenges</h3>
                    <p>NPCs conform to human nature and aren't player slaves. If player education methods aren't good, after two months of player absence, a "charismatic NPC leader" might emerge within the force, making other NPCs respect them instead of the player; when the player returns, they might pay lip service or even assassinate the player.</p>
                    <p>A simple effective education method is: forced worship. Require NPCs to worship ancestors (player's first character) every ten years (one Earth hour). This can greatly reduce NPC rebellion rates, but can't 100% prevent it. For a cure, players need to consider other methods, like establishing a supervision department.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="technical-note">
                    <p>There are no options like "forced worship" or "establish supervision department" in the game. In the first-generation official server, players implement these operations through "buildings + proposals + punishment." The proposal format is "When certain time (or now), you do certain thing"; buildings serve as memory-like existences, implementing "When A, you change building to X. When B and building is X, you do certain thing." When NPCs disobey, players can attack NPCs as punishment; when NPCs obey, players can gift items as rewards.</p>
                    <p>I know this rule isn't perfect, but to ensure AI's free actions, this is the temporary solution. In the second-generation official server, I'll make changes, enhancing NPC intelligence so they understand player concerns and think about verifying solutions; adding some atomic emotional expressions, so players only need to "have the second character bring elders, erect a monument to the ancestor, worship, make 'moved' expressions, and when elders don't act, make 'angry' expressions toward elders," and elders will understand they should worship.</p>
                    <p class="tip">The reason we're not using this approach in the first generation is because the current first-generation approach in my research is mature and can implement psychological AI NPCs. While this second-generation approach seems better, I'm uncertain about many algorithmic details and need more research. It's also best to develop the second generation based on the first generation after completing the development of first-generation AI.</p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Although there's little technical difference between single-player and online modes, they provide completely different player experiences.</p>
                <p>In single-player mode, players are more like that character, and the forces they establish are just for resource production and territory defense.</p>
                <p>In online mode, players are more like that force, with their numerous characters burning lifetimes just for the force's immortality, or pursuing that vague Dao Merging opportunity. Only after Dao Merging can they truly experience this world leisurely as characters (can use life rules to maintain a new character's lifespan in the Sacred Land, so as long as this character doesn't stay outside longer than their lifespan, they won't die from depleted lifespan, refilling lifespan each time they return to the Sacred Land. But this consumes some Sacred Land origin, it's okay for personal use but can't be promoted as a service to the public; also can't support too high-level cultivators (the higher the realm, the greater the origin consumption to supplement their lifespan. Yuan Ying and below can be supported)).</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Therefore, online won't make single-player boring, and single-player won't make online boring. The two don't compete, can both be profitable, and even promote each other: single-player players want to go online to personally prepare for the Age of Great Contention, online players want to go to single-player for a leisurely adventurer's life.</p>

                        <h4>Single-player Mode Features</h4>
                        <p>No need to consider lifespan. Even mortals, with a 1:60 flow rate, have over a year of Earth time lifespan. Assuming players play eight hours per day, it would take four Earth years to deplete a mortal's lifespan, let alone increasing realm to extend lifespan.</p>
                        <p>Realm advancement is also more convenient; what takes dozens of character generations to reach Yuan Ying in online can be reached in dozens of hours in single-player.</p>
                        <p>Single-player is a power fantasy, conforming to the flow curve, with each realm's difficulty gap equaling the flow time gap: 1.6 times (Foundation Establishment to Golden Core twenty-five hours, Golden Core to Yuan Ying forty hours, Yuan Ying to Divine Transformation sixty-four hours)</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comparison-column">
                        <h4>Online Mode Features</h4>
                        <p>It's a truly cruel cultivation world, with each realm's difficulty gap equaling the population gap: thirty times (thirty Foundation Establishment produces one Golden Core, thirty Golden Core produces one Yuan Ying)</p>
                        <p>This includes NPCs; NPC intelligence is inferior to players, most of those 29 who didn't advance are NPCs, so for pure players, it's about ten times difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Force immortality, Dao Merging sainthood, players essentially are forces rather than characters, bringing an extremely unique game experience.</p>

                <h2>Arts Should Not Have Learning Quantity Limits</h2>
                <p>In "Ghost Valley Eight Realms," a character can only learn one movement technique, one divine ability, one combat skill, and eight mental arts. If you want to learn new ones, you have to erase the old ones first. This design ensures the balance of the combat system but also leads to unrealism: why limit the number of arts one can learn? Why can't I learn a hundred arts? You can make it so that the more I learn, the more scattered the effects, but you can't prohibit me from learning.</p>
                <p>However, I also understand: if "the more you learn, the worse the effect," then for game designers, balancing numbers would be a daunting task. Moreover, many mechanical skills are very powerful even with reduced stats, making balance even more difficult, so designers didn't do this.</p>
                <p>But this article proposes a new solution that allows unlimited skill learning while easily maintaining balance. This solution is based on the analysis that "there's no need to prohibit learning skills, just restrict casting skills. Learning doesn't equal freely casting" and borrows from the dynamic restriction thinking of "operation depends on environment, operation changes environment" from the dilemma of solutions.</p>
                <p>Simply put: to cast a certain skill, the character's "state" needs to meet standards, with different standards for different skills. After each skill cast, the character's "state" changes. This prevents characters from freely casting skills. Additionally, we will provide many "Paths of Pseudo-Saint" to prevent players from being discouraged by difficulty.</p>
                <p>Note: Path of Pseudo-Saint: The perfect solution is very complex, but you can achieve rapid ascension and approach perfection through many simple methods - these simple methods are the Paths of Pseudo-Saint. Here, one Pseudo-Saint path is where players don't need to focus on states and state changes, just view it as "seven types of skills exist, called ABCDEFG. After casting an A-type skill, the next skill can only be B-type, after B comes C... after a full ABCDEFG cycle, return to A." The combat power limit of this method is only about 20% lower than the "True Saint path" which uses skills beyond the seven types with almost no pattern in state changes.</p>
                <p>We will provide many Paths of Pseudo-Saint. Another path references acidity and alkalinity from chemistry.</p>

            <section id="acid-alkaline">
                <h2>Path of Pseudo-Saint: Acidity and Alkalinity</h2>
                <p>There is a type of skill (called H-type) that can be viewed as "the character has acidity-alkalinity, each skill requires the character's acidity-alkalinity to be within a certain range to cast, and each skill changes the character's acidity-alkalinity after casting." There are also two skills: "Acidification" and "Alkalization" with 1-second cooldowns, unlimited use, and no effects other than +1/-1 to acidity-alkalinity.</p>
                <p>Using League of Legends as an example, adding acidity-alkalinity to Master Yi's skills:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Q Alpha Strike: Requires acidity-alkalinity > 7, after use acidity-alkalinity -1</li>
                    <li>R Highlander: Requires acidity-alkalinity > 8</li>
                    <li>E Wuju Style: Requires acidity-alkalinity > 8</li>
                    <li>W Meditate: Requires acidity-alkalinity between 3 and 5, after use acidity-alkalinity -1</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In this case, Master Yi cannot use AWA in battle (because acidity-alkalinity can't meet requirements, no time to alkalize), and after meditation, he can't immediately use R to fight, so when you see him meditating, you can temporarily consider him non-threatening.</p>
                <p>Note: H-type skills form a complete set including combat, movement, healing, control, and all types at all levels, so a player can never learn about other types of skills - just learning H-type is enough. The ABCDEFG seven types together also form a complete set. A first-class sect typically has a complete set of skills and a Path of Pseudo-Saint built on this complete set.</p>

            <section id="true-saint">
                <h2>Path of True Saint: Five-Dimensional Vector</h2>
                <p>Each Pseudo-Saint path principle is a special case of the True Saint path principle. (Principles: seven-type cycle, acidity-alkalinity)</p>
                <p>The principle of the True Saint path is: a character's state consists of five parameters, forming a five-dimensional vector. Each time a skill is cast, all five parameters change simultaneously; the casting condition for each skill is that these five parameters meet certain conditions (not just "parameter 1 greater than 5" but also conditions like "parameter 1 + parameter 2 equals 9").</p>
                <p>The seven-type cycle, in essence, means that within each type, the five-dimensional effects are the same, and the seven types' effects on the five dimensions form a loop in five-dimensional space; acidity-alkalinity is essentially a partial ordering in five-dimensional space, similar to the existence of a main sequence; dozens of other Pseudo-Saint paths are essentially certain "rule shapes" in five-dimensional space.</p>
                <p>After understanding this, players can try adding a skill from another type to their Pseudo-Saint path. Adding just one skill should be manageable and will bring a huge power boost, because although each complete set has all types of skills, having everything doesn't mean excelling at everything. For instance, the same long-distance movement, the Sword Sect's flying sword is definitely not as good as the Realm Sect's directional teleportation, and these sects use different Pseudo-Saint paths. So a Sword Sect cultivator can learn one directional teleportation as an exception skill to their Pseudo-Saint path and study its impact on the Sword Sect's Pseudo-Saint path.</p>
                <p>After mastering one exception, you can start introducing a second, a third... When you're using almost all exceptions and no longer rely on Pseudo-Saint paths, you've embarked on the Path of True Saint.</p>

            <section id="other-games">
                <h2>Extension: Other Games</h2>
                <p>The concept of Pseudo-Saint paths is very important, not only for Fengshen World but also applicable to almost all games.</p>
                <p>Any game that discourages players due to complex gameplay can introduce Pseudo-Saint paths, avoiding discouragement and ensuring that "gameplay complexity never becomes a disadvantage." The more complex, the better.</p>
                <p>Its fundamental idea is: allow gameplay to be complex, but encapsulate the complex gameplay so players don't need to understand it - they just need to use a special case manifestation to have fun.</p>
                <p>Describing the fundamental idea of Pseudo-Saint paths in a simpler sentence: the more complex quantum mechanics is, the better; the simpler classical mechanics is, the better; classical mechanics is a Pseudo-Saint path of quantum mechanics.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="post-performance">
                <h2>Extension: Posterior Expression</h2>
                <p>Thanks to the five-dimensional True Saint path, traditional game elements like "channeled spells" and "interrupt channeling" become posterior expressions in Fengshen World. (A concept is a posterior expression when it doesn't exist in the game but players summarize it. For example, in World of Warcraft, classes are predetermined - players choose a class with one click, while in EVE, classes are posterior - players' numerous actions lead them to call themselves a certain profession. Posterior expression is also an important concept: the standard for measuring a game's freedom is how many posterior expressions it has; more posterior expressions mean more freedom.)</p>
                <p>In Fengshen World, so-called channeled spells are essentially "powerful skills with extremely strict casting conditions, requiring players to first use various auxiliary skills (like acidification or alkalization) to meet those conditions." Interrupting spells affects the opponent's state, such as the top-tier interrupting spell "Chaos Art: Randomizes the target's five-dimensional state, and for one minute afterward, the target's state dimension changes are reduced by 50% (e.g., after casting, acidity +1 becomes +0.5)." To cultivators on the Pseudo-Saint path, this Chaos Art might be called "Seal Magic: prevents the target from casting spells" with the following manifestations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In extremely rare cases, the sealing magic fails. (Essence: for example, if you cultivate acidity-alkalinity, the chaotic result is on the main sequence by extremely small chance)</li>
                    <li>With small probability, after being sealed, you can still cast one or two spells before permanently losing the ability to cast. (Essence: those two spells have broad conditions, still satisfied after chaos)</li>
                    <li>The Pill Sect might have ways to remove the seal. (Essence: some pills also affect the five-dimensional state. The Pill Sect can investigate your state, prescribe a series of pills, and after consumption, you can restore your state to your Pseudo-Saint path)</li>
                    <li>Divine path cultivators (True Saint path) don't fear sealing magic; they only need to rest briefly after being sealed before fighting again. (Essence: Divine path cultivators have various means to change their five-dimensional state)</li>
                    <li>If you join a Divine path sect, cultivate Divine path techniques to perceive your five-dimensional state, and learn Divine path arts (i.e., No Way, All Ways), you'll discover: the sealing magic that once made you despair can now be solved instantly; once you thought you'd never reach immortal gates, now you can return in an instant. (Non-Divine paths can't check five-dimensional states. Each cultivation method corresponds to a UI panel: in Cycle methods, you can only see if your state is ABCDEFG or chaotic; in Yin-Yang methods, you can only see your Yin-Yang value (acidity-alkalinity) or chaos. Only Divine path methods allow you to see your five-dimensional state)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sealing magic is the posterior expression of chaos art.</p>
                <p>Fengshen World has many posterior expressions, and these expressions can be mathematically and logically deduced rather than defined by developers. Such games are truly enjoyable.</p>
                <p>(Subjective: Excited. Why do traditional games have few posterior expressions? Because I'm too strong! They're too weak!)</p>

                <h2>Extension: Runes</h2>
                <p>How to implement the manifestation of "a spell requiring ten minutes of channeling"? Even the most stringent state requirements wouldn't take ten minutes to meet, right?</p>
                <p>For this, the solution is: non-integer requirements.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Powerful spell: The first parameter of the five dimensions needs to be between 72.84 and 72.89</li>
                    <li>Metal Intent Transformation: Five dimensions' first parameter +1</li>
                    <li>Five Elements Weak Intent: For the next minute, spells like Metal Intent Transformation have reduced effect on state changes (how much is reduced is random and unqueryable. Can only be observed by executing Metal Intent Transformation)</li>
                    <li>In the Divine path method panel, the five elements only display integers, showing rounded values.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This way, meeting the requirements needs constant trial. Players can write a rune for automatic attempts; the recommended rune's expected success time is ten minutes. (Rune: a built-in programming language, with syntax more similar to natural language than Python)</p>
                <p>Recommended rune demonstration: (Recommended rune, not the optimal one. Players can optimize it)</p>
                <pre><code>
First, ensure the current five-dimensional state's first parameter is an integer, set as X.
Then, cast Five Elements Weak Intent.
Then, cast Mirror Heart Art. (Note: Mirror Heart Art: Saves the current state for ten seconds. When cast again, changes self-state to the saved one)
Then, cast Metal Edge 100 times. Set the current five-dimensional state's first parameter as Y. (Note: Metal Edge: Five-dimensional state's first parameter +1, other parameters change randomly, short CD. Affected by Five Elements Weak Intent)
Then, calculate Z = (Y-X)/100.
...(The rest is checking if Z is good; Z indicates how much weakening specifically, to two decimal places. Too high or too low is not good; if not good, reapply weak intent; if good, mirror heart back, cast to extend weak intent time, then start adjusting the state)
Definition: Ensure the current five-dimensional state's first parameter is an integer:
First, try to cast Metal Square Shield. If successful, confirm passage. Otherwise, cast Five Elements Curse, then confirm passage. (Note: Metal Square Shield: Condition: Five-dimensional first parameter is an integer. Effect: Gain a shield. Five Elements Curse: Consume one year of lifespan, mark a target - can track it for three days regardless of distance, self five-dimensional -10 and round down. If no target specified, randomly select the highest cultivation being nearby.)
                </code></pre>
                <p>Runes have many uses. Besides automatic channeling, they can automatically sell junk from inventory (custom selling rules), auto-purchase, auto-manage forces, custom proposals, custom positions...</p>
                <p>Custom proposals: Runes can customize various proposals, such as recruitment. The game doesn't have recruitment functionality in the predetermined sense, but has recruitment as a posterior expression. Players can make proposals to NPCs, using rune language to define recruitment (e.g., you help me farm, I give you money), and NPCs will consider whether to accept the proposal. (Note that NPCs may lie, take the money and run)</p>
                <p>The game will have built-in massive runes. Players can use them directly, optimize them, or customize them. (Players can use built-in runes without reading their content. This is also a Path of Pseudo-Saint. Correspondingly, writing runes directly is the Path of True Saint.)</p>
                <p>Traditional games prohibit scripts, but Fengshen World encourages scripts, even embedding many quality runes; all repetitive tasks can be automated through runes. As players continuously advance in class, they can always focus on cutting-edge problems, avoiding situations like "Micro Master: As the ruler of a country, do I still need to micro-manage each soldier's movement during war?"</p>
                <p>The best rhythm is for players to use automation runes for "Stage A" when they "have mastered Stage A and are entering Stage B," rather than "using Stage A automation runes as soon as they enter Stage A." We will control numerical rhythms well to ensure most players follow this rhythm.</p>
                <p>As a free game, we won't forcibly control rhythm; our approach to controlling rhythm is "knowledge barriers": built-in runes for mainline automation will be made technically challenging, not foolproof, and full of common sense omissions. This means if players haven't mastered A, they can't use A's automation runes well, causing players to discard A's runes even when they see them. (First, mainline automation runes aren't pure idle play but information compression, e.g., auto-planning lets generals manage soldiers and report to you, and you need to understand the report format defined in the rune; or the rune fills your UI with buttons like building outposts or various bizarre building clusters, without any prompts or explanations. Only after designing your own outpost brick by brick will you understand the button's meaning; those bizarre building clusters you might not have built before, but if you've experienced a lot of manual operations, you can understand their usage at a glance and praise their ingenuity or point out their flaws. Second, non-mainline automation built-in runes are foolproof, such as recruitment, inventory organization, etc.)</p>

            <section id="summary">
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>This article proposes two cross-game concepts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Path of Pseudo-Saint</span>: With Pseudo-Saint paths, complexity will never be a disadvantage for games. The more complex, the better.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Posterior Expression</span>: The more posterior expressions a game has, the higher its freedom.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And some settings for Fengshen World:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No skill restrictions. Characters can learn countless skills. Casting spells requires the character's state to meet standards, and casting spells also affects the character's state. The character's state is a five-dimensional vector. This complex setting derives Cycle methods, Yin-Yang methods, and other Pseudo-Saint paths, as well as Divine path methods, Chaos Art/Sealing Magic, and other settings.</li>
                    <li>Channeled spells and interrupting spells are all posterior expressions. High channeling duration spells are essentially non-integer strict requirements + reflective calibration. (Reflective calibration: The calibration, i.e., the degree of weakening, can only be known through reflection. Reflection: Apply it, observe the performance, reverse calculate)</li>
                    <li>No script restrictions. Encourage players to use runes to automate low-level operations. As players grow stronger, the definition of "low-level" continues to extend. Through knowledge barriers, players typically won't use runes for high-level operations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Finally, repeating the brief introduction of Fengshen World:</p>
                <p>"Fengshen World," a fantasy strategy RPG game, single-player with one-time purchase, global release.</p>
                <p>Fengshen World is an AI-driven, vast sandbox world with a fantasy worldview. The entire world can operate on its own even without players, with dynasties rising and falling.</p>
                <p>Over 10,000 planes, 10 billion NPCs, real-time calculations. At the start, players enter Fengshen World as mortals. No storyline, no quests, complete freedom.</p>
                <p>Players can embark on solo RPG adventures, wander the world finding joy in exploring secrets, or establish forces, engage in strategic domination with conquering the world as their goal.</p>
